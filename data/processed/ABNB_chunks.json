Brian and Joe \u0097 two of our founders and friends from design\nschool \u0097 were looking for a way to cover the cost of their San Francisco apartment. That week, they saw an opportunity. An international design conference was coming to town, and every hotel was sold out. They quickly created a website,\nAirBedandBreakfast.com, with the hope of renting airbeds in their apartment to attendees of the conference. Three designers, Michael, Kat, and Amol, took them up on their offer and became the first guests of Brian and Joe, our first hosts.\n\nWhen Brian and Joe told people what they were doing, they thought the idea sounded crazy. \u0093Strangers will never stay in each other\u0092s\nhomes,\u0094 they said. But something unexpected happened that first weekend.

Brian and Joe treated their guests like old friends from out of town, connecting them to a unique slice of San Francisco that they could never have experienced on their\nown. Michael, Kat, and Amol came as outsiders, but left feeling like locals. The experience left Brian and Joe feeling something special too \u0097 the excitement of sharing the city they loved and seeing their guests form a deep connection to it.\n\nBrian and Joe started thinking: maybe there were more people like Michael, Kat, and Amol who would like to travel this way and more people who\nwould like to host this way. These are the ideas that Airbnb was founded on.\n\nIn 2008, Nate, a software engineer, joined Brian and Joe, and\ntogether the three founders took on a bigger design problem: how do you make strangers feel comfortable enough to stay in each other\u0092s\n\n\n\nhomes? The key was trust. The solution they designed combined host and guest profiles, integrated messaging,\ntwo-way\nreviews, and secure payments built on\na technology platform that unlocked trust, and eventually led to hosting at a global scale that was unimaginable at the time.\n\n13 Years Later\n\nToday, the idea does not seem so crazy after all. Our more than 4 million hosts now offer everything from a private room in their home\nto luxury villas, from one night to several months at a time. Hosting has expanded from homes to now include experiences that can be taken in cities all over the world, or even online. In more than 220 countries and regions around the world, our\nhosts have welcomed over 825 million guest arrivals and have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. \u0093Airbnb\u0094 has become synonymous with\none-of-a-kind\ntravel on a global scale.\n\nLooking back over the past 13 years, we have done\nsomething we hope is even more meaningful: we have helped millions of people satisfy a fundamental human need for connection. And it is through this connection that people can experience a greater sense of belonging. This is at the root of what\nbrought people to Airbnb and is what continues to bring people back.",

This is at the root of what\nbrought people to Airbnb and is what continues to bring people back.\n\nA New Category\n\nTravel is one of the world\u0092s largest industries, and its approach has become commoditized. The travel industry has scaled by offering\nstandardized accommodations in crowded hotel districts and frequently-visited landmarks and attractions. This\none-size-fits-all\n\napproach has limited how much of the world a person can access, and as a result, guests are often left feeling like outsiders in the places they visit.\n\nAirbnb has enabled home sharing at a global scale and created a new category of travel. Instead of traveling like tourists and feeling like outsiders,\nguests on Airbnb can stay in neighborhoods where people live, have authentic experiences, live like locals, and spend time with locals in approximately 100,000 cities around the world. In our early days, we described this new type of travel with the\ntagline \u0093Travel like a human.\u0094 Today, people simply refer to it with a single word: \u0093Airbnb.\u0094\n\nHosting is at the Center\n\nHosting is the foundation of the Airbnb experience. Airbnb enables hosts to provide guests access to a vast world of unique homes and\nexperiences that were previously inaccessible, or even undiscovered. The role of the host is about more than opening their door. A great host enables guests to find a deeper connection to the places they visit and the people who live there.\n\nWhat began with our hosts sharing their spare bedrooms on Airbnb in a few large cities has grown into hosts listing spaces of all kinds, in\ncommunities of all sizes, in nearly every corner of the world. Today, hosts even share their interests and talents through Airbnb Experiences.",

There are many more ways people will want to connect with each other and the world around them, and so we will continue to design and enable new ways to\nhost. No matter what form it takes, hosting will be at the center of Airbnb.\n\n\n\nGuests are Members of Our Community\n\nOur hosts have welcomed hundreds of millions of guest arrivals through Airbnb. Our guests are not transactions \u0097 they are engaged, contributing\nmembers of our community. Once they become a part of Airbnb, guests actively participate in our community, return regularly to our platform to book again, and recommend Airbnb to others who then join themselves. This demand encourages new hosts to\njoin, which in turn attracts even more guests. It is a virtuous cycle \u0097 guests attract hosts, and hosts attract guests.\n\nA Resilient Model\n\nIn early 2020, as\nCOVID-19\ndisrupted travel across the world, Airbnb\u0092s business declined\nsignificantly. But within two months, our business model started to rebound even with limited international travel, demonstrating its resilience. People wanted to get out of their homes and yearned to travel, but they did not want to go far or to be\nin crowded hotel lobbies. Domestic travel quickly rebounded on Airbnb around the world as millions of guests took trips closer to home. Stays of longer than a few days started increasing as work-from-home became\nwork-from-any-home\non Airbnb. We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere.

It is their individuality that makes Airbnb unique. From schoolteachers\nto artists, our hosts span more than 220 countries and regions and approximately 100,000 cities, and 55% of our hosts are women. As of September 30, 2020, we had over 4 million hosts around the world, with 86% of hosts located outside of\nthe United States.\n\nOur hosts had 7.4 million available listings of homes and experiences as of September 30, 2020, of which\n5.6 million were active listings. We consider a listing of a home or an experience to be an \u0093active listing\u0094 if it is viewable on Airbnb and has been previously booked at least once on Airbnb. In 2019, 84% of our revenue resulted from\nstays with existing hosts who had completed at least one guest check-in event (a \u0093check-in\u0094) on or before December 31, 2018. Our hosts largely come to us organically with 75% of our hosts coming directly to our platform to sign up to host\nin 2019. In 2019, we added more hosts than any year in our history with 23% of our new hosts first starting out as guests on Airbnb.\n\nWhy\ndo they host?\n\nOur hosts have multiple motivations for hosting on Airbnb:\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Hosts can earn extra income.In a 2019 survey of hosts that we conducted, half of our\nhosts told us that the supplemental income they generated helped them afford to stay in their homes.\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Hosts can connect guests to their communities.In the same survey, of the hosts who made\nrecommendations, 87% said that they recommend local restaurants and cafes to their guests, and 82% said they recommend businesses that are locally owned.\n[/TABLE]",

The system for trust that we have\ndesigned includes: reviews, secure messaging and account protection,\n\nrisk scoring, secure payments, watchlist and background checks, cleanliness standards, fraud and scam prevention, insurance and protections, age restrictions, an urgent\nsafety line, a 24/7 neighborhood support line, and our guest refund policy. We deploy some of these features such as reviews and secure payments globally, and others such as background checks in specific countries and regions.\n\nOur Market Opportunity\n\nWe have a\nsubstantial market opportunity in the growing travel market and experience economy. We estimate our serviceable addressable market (\u0093SAM\u0094) today to be $1.5 trillion, including $1.2 trillion for short-term stays and $239 billion for\nexperiences. We estimate our total addressable market (\u0093TAM\u0094) to be $3.4 trillion, including $1.8 trillion for short-term stays, $210 billion for long-term stays, and $1.4 trillion for experiences.\n\nWe have estimated key components of our SAM and TAM using 2019 actual figures and believe our market opportunity can grow over the long term at the\nrate of travel spending. While the current travel market remains unpredictable, we believe estimates made prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to be the best representation of our long-term travel opportunity.\n\n\n\nOur Strengths\n\nWe have six core strengths that helped Airbnb create a new category and give us a competitive advantage:\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Unique host community.The more than 4 million hosts in our community are as unique\nas the homes and experiences they share, with the majority of our 5.6 million active listings only available on Airbnb.\n[/TABLE]",

In order to protect our business from these near-term market disruptions\nand the prospect of a prolonged business impact, we raised $2.0 billion in the form of term loans in April 2020 and took action to dramatically reduce our operating expenses as described below.

People have increasingly sought travel options closer to home during\nCOVID-19,\nand Airbnb\u0092s offerings are well suited to adapt to this changing dynamic. We offer all types of accommodations,\nallowing guests to find spaces suited to their individual needs under these circumstances. We have worked closely with our hosts, guests, and communities to prioritize and support safe and responsible travel during these challenging times and\nhave adapted our offerings for changing trends in travel and experiences. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines have listed homes shared with members of the same household as safer than hotels during the pandemic, which\nsupports the way guests travel on our platform.\n\nWe believe that the recovery in the second and third quarters of 2020 is attributable to the\nrenewed ability and willingness for guests to travel, the resilience of our hosts, and relative strength of our business model. From December 31, 2019 through September 30, 2020, active listings remained stable at approximately\n5.6 million despite the decline in booking activity on our platform due to\nCOVID-19.\nAgainst an otherwise highly negative travel backdrop, there are several areas of our business that have shown\nresilience, notably, domestic travel, short-distance travel, travel outside of our top 20 cities, and long-term stays.

During the fourth quarter of 2020, another wave of COVID-19 infections emerged. As a\nresult, countries imposed strict lockdowns, in particular in Europe.

As a result, we expect significantly greater\nyear-over-year decline in Nights and Experiences Booked and GBV in the fourth quarter of 2020 than in the third quarter of 2020 and greater year-over-year increases in cancellations and alterations in the fourth quarter of 2020 than in the third\nquarter of 2020.

Hotels and groups affiliated with hotels have engaged and will likely continue to engage in various lobbying and political efforts for stricter regulations governing our business in both local and\nnational jurisdictions. Other private groups, such as homeowners, landlords, and condominium and neighborhood associations, have adopted contracts or regulations that purport to ban or otherwise restrict short-term rentals, and third-party lease\nagreements between landlords and tenants, home insurance policies, and mortgages may prevent or restrict the ability of hosts to list their spaces. In Europe, a group of mayors representing 22 cities (including Amsterdam, Barcelona, and London) has\nbeen meeting with the European Commission to seek increased regulatory control in relation\n\n\n\nto short-term rental platforms. These groups and others cite concerns around affordable housing and over-tourism in major cities, and some state and local governments have implemented or\nconsidered implementing rules, ordinances, or regulations governing the short-term rental of properties and/or home sharing. Such regulations include ordinances that restrict or ban hosts from short-term rentals, set annual caps on the number of\ndays hosts can share their homes, require hosts to register with the municipality or city, or require hosts to obtain permission before offering short-term rentals. In addition, some jurisdictions regard short-term rental or home sharing as\n\u0093hotel use\u0094 and claim that such use constitutes a conversion of a residential property to a commercial property requiring a permitting process.

Some European jurisdictions have also proposed or intend to pass legislation that imposes new obligations and liabilities on platforms with respect to certain types of harmful content. In\nparallel, the European Commission is working on a legislative proposal to introduce new ex ante regulation of online platforms and new market investigation powers as a separate piece of legislation, the Digital Markets Act (\u0093DMA\u0094). If the\nDMA is enacted, it may contain certain regulatory requirements and/or obligations that negatively impact our business. Some European jurisdictions (such as the United Kingdom and Germany) are also reviewing their competition rules in relation to\ndigital platforms which could lead to new regulations similar to the DMA at national level. While the scope and timing of these proposals are currently uncertain, if enacted and applied to our platform, the new rules may adversely affect our\nbusiness. In countries in Asia and Latin America, generally there are not similar statutes as the CDA or\nE-Commerce\nDirective.

For example, in November 2019, we announced a partnership with the\nInternational Olympic Committee for nine years to cover the next five Olympic Games. The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed the 2020 Olympics, and the continued uncertainty around COVID-19 and other geopolitical factors could undermine our ability to\nrealize the value of the partnership. If our competitors spend increasingly more on brand marketing efforts, we may not be able to maintain and grow traffic to our platform.\n\nWe have used performance marketing products offered by search engines and social media platforms to distribute paid advertisements that drive traffic\nto our platform. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, approximately 23% and approximately 9%, respectively, of the traffic to our platform came from paid performance marketing channels. The\nremainder of our traffic in those periods came through direct or unpaid channels, which include brand marketing and search engine optimization (\u0093SEO\u0094). A critical factor in attracting hosts and guests to our platform is how prominently\nlistings are displayed in response to search queries for key search terms. The success of home\n\n\n\nsharing and our brand has led to increased costs for relevant keywords as our competitors competitively bid on our keywords, including our brand name. We have suspended substantially all\nperformance marketing efforts as we take mitigating actions in relation to the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. Our strategy is to increase brand marketing and use the strength of our brand to attract more",

However, we may not be successful at our efforts to drive traffic growth cost-effectively.

In addition, we expect to generate\nsignificant stock compensation deductions as a result of this offering starting in the fourth quarter of 2020, which will substantially increase the size of our net operating loss carryforwards. Realization of these net operating loss\ncarryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.

In July 2019, the UK Financial Conduct\nAuthority (\u0093FCA\u0094) called on UK electronic money institutions to review their compliance with the requirements on safeguarding of customer funds and to notify the FCA in the event they identified any material non-compliance. APUK notified\nthe FCA that it had identified gaps in its compliance and was undertaking remedial action. The FCA, in turn, appointed a third-party skilled person to perform a review of APUK\u0092s safeguarding systems and controls, in accordance with Section 166\nof the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended) and all required actions identified by the skilled person have now been completed.\n\n\n\nAs part of its review, the skilled person also identified certain issues with APUK\u0092s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing systems and controls.

Brian and Joe \u0097 two of our founders and friends from design\nschool \u0097 were looking for a way to cover the cost of their San Francisco apartment. That week, they saw an opportunity. An international design conference was coming to town, and every hotel was sold out. They quickly created a website,\nAirBedandBreakfast.com, with the hope of renting airbeds in their apartment to attendees of the conference. Three designers, Michael, Kat, and Amol, took them up on their offer and became the first guests of Brian and Joe, our first hosts.\n\nWhen Brian and Joe told people what they were doing, they thought the idea sounded crazy. \u0093Strangers will never stay in each other\u0092s\nhomes,\u0094 they said. But something unexpected happened that first weekend. Brian and Joe treated their guests like old friends from out of town, connecting them to a unique slice of San Francisco that they could never have experienced on their\nown. Michael, Kat, and Amol came as outsiders, but left feeling like locals. The experience left Brian and Joe feeling something special too \u0097 the excitement of sharing the city they loved and seeing their guests form a deep connection to it.\n\nBrian and Joe started thinking: maybe there were more people like Michael, Kat, and Amol who would like to travel this way and more people who\nwould like to host this way. These are the ideas that Airbnb was founded on.\n\nIn 2008, Nate, a software engineer, joined Brian and Joe, and\ntogether the three founders took on a bigger design problem: how do you make strangers feel comfortable enough to stay in each other\u0092s homes? The key was trust. The solution they designed combined host and guest profiles, integrated messaging,\ntwo-way\nreviews, and secure payments built on a technology platform that unlocked trust, and eventually led to hosting at a global scale that was unimaginable at the time.",

Our more than 4 million hosts now offer everything from a private room in their home to luxury\nvillas, from one night to several months at a time. Hosting has expanded from homes to now include experiences that can be taken in cities all over the world, or even online. In more than 220 countries and regions around the world, our hosts have\nwelcomed over 825 million guest arrivals and have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. \u0093Airbnb\u0094 has become synonymous with\n\none-of-a-kind\ntravel on a global scale.\n\n\n\nOur Business Model\n\nWe operate a global marketplace, where hosts offer guests stays and experiences on our platform. As of September 30, 2020, our more than\n4 million hosts had 7.4 million available listings of homes and experiences, of which 5.6 million were active listings. Our listings include private rooms, entire homes, luxury villas, treehouses, igloos, and experiences, in\napproximately 100,000 cities across more than 220 countries and regions. In 2019, 63% of our revenue was generated from listings outside of the United States. We believe that we have the largest collection of unique listings available for guests.\nAvailable listings are accommodations and experiences that are viewable on a certain date on our platform (excluding Hotel Tonight). We count the number of hosts on our platform based on the number of users with available listings as of a certain\ndate; some individuals may have more than one account.

An active booker is a unique guest who has booked a stay or\nexperience in a given period. Guest arrivals represent an individual and all co-travelers included on a reservation for a stay for completed check-ins during a given period. Because an individual guest may take more than one trip in a measurement\nperiod for guest arrivals, such guest will be counted separately for each check-in when calculating total guest arrivals for a period. In comparison, a check-in represents a check-in event for a single reservation for a stay or experience,\nregardless of the number of travelers or experience participants.\n\nOur business model relies on the success of hosts and guests who join our\ncommunity and generate consistent bookings over time. As hosts become more successful on our platform and as guests return over time, we benefit from the recurring activity of our community. For example, in 2019, 84% of our revenue resulted from\nstays with existing hosts who had completed at least one guest\ncheck-in\non or before December 31, 2018, up from 82% in 2018 and 77% in 2017.

TTM Free Cash Flow provides a longer-term view of our business that is not impacted by seasonality. Our costs are relatively fixed across quarters\nor vary in line with the volume of transactions, and we historically achieve our highest GBV in the first and second quarters of the year with comparatively lower check-ins. As a result, increases in unearned fees make our Free Cash Flow and Free\nCash Flow as a percentage of revenue the highest in the first two quarters of the year. We typically see a slight decline in GBV and a peak in check-ins in the third quarter, which results in a decrease in unearned fees and lower sequential level of\nFree Cash Flow, and a greater decline in GBV in the fourth quarter, where Free Cash Flow is typically negative.

The COVID-19\n\n\n\npandemic has forced international, federal, state, and local governments to enforce prohibitions of\nnon-essential\nactivities. The outbreak will have a\ncontinued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and has already triggered a period of global economic slowdown, the depth and breadth of which are yet to be determined.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in global travel restrictions and a corresponding significant reduction in travel. While many industries have been\nadversely impacted, travel has been disproportionately affected, as governments have implemented travel restrictions and as people have become reluctant to travel irrespective of such restrictions. As a result, global scheduled flights began to\ndecline in February 2020, and by May 2020 were down 69% relative to May 2019.

Because long-term stays have lower GBV per night and lower service fees, the revenue by trip length is weighted more toward short-term stays.\n\nCOVID-19 Cost Reductions Position Our Business for Improved Financial Performance\n\nIn response to the spread of\nCOVID-19\nand the resulting material decrease in GBV, we undertook an internal\nreview of our cost structure, ultimately making changes to improve the strength of our business in the long term. Specifically, we significantly reduced our fixed and variable costs, which we believe will result in improved operating leverage as we\nemerge from\nCOVID-19.\nWe rapidly made changes to manage our expenses in a period of material business interruption, which included the following, among others:",

Additionally, our effective tax rate can vary based on the\namount of\npre-tax\nincome or loss.

The notice proposes an increase to our U.S. taxable income that could result in additional income tax expense\nand cash tax liability of $1.35 billion, plus penalties and interest, which exceeds our current reserve recorded in our consolidated financial statements by more than $1.0 billion. A formal Notice of Proposed Adjustment is expected from\nthe IRS by the end of 2020. Following formal receipt of the Revenue Agent\u0092s adjustment which is anticipated late in the fourth quarter of 2020, we intend to vigorously contest the IRS\u0092s proposed adjustment, including through all\nadministrative and, if necessary, judicial remedies which may include: entering into administrative settlement discussions with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (\u0093IRS Appeals\u0094) in 2021, and if necessary petitioning the U.S. Tax Court\n(\u0093Tax Court\u0094) for redetermination if an acceptable outcome cannot be reached with IRS Appeals, and finally, and if necessary, appealing the Tax Court\u0092s decision to the appropriate appellate court.

However, as\nrevenue is recorded upon\ncheck-in,\nrevenue is impacted significantly by seasonality. Revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter as guests plan for travel later in the year, and revenue is highest in the\nthird quarter, or when we have the most\ncheck-ins,\nas the third quarter is the peak travel season for North America and EMEA. Revenue in the second quarter of 2020 significantly decreased as COVID-19 disrupted\ntravel across the world and resulted in materially higher cancellations and fewer bookings. Revenue in the third quarter of 2020 improved as domestic travel rebounded, but was below revenue for the same period in 2019.\n\nCost of Revenue\n\nOn a quarterly\nbasis, cost of revenue generally increased in 2019 compared to the corresponding quarterly periods of 2018 primarily due to the growth in GBV resulting in higher payment processing costs, with a slight seasonal decrease in the first and fourth\nquarters. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for each quarter of 2019 remained relatively consistent when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. Cost of revenue decreased in each quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019\nas a result of a\n\n\n\ndecline in payment processing costs driven by fewer transactions on our platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue in the second quarter of 2020 increased\nfrom the second quarter of 2019 primarily because costs represented a greater proportion of lower revenue recorded in the period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the third quarter of 2020, cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 17% compared",

Accordingly, to satisfy these tax withholding obligations, we will withhold the number of shares\nnecessary to satisfy the tax obligations based on the initial public offering price. We currently expect that the average of these withholding tax rates will be approximately 43%. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from this\noffering to satisfy the anticipated tax withholding and remittance obligations of approximately $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020 related to our outstanding RSUs that will settle in connection with this offering, based on\n56.5 million RSUs outstanding for which the service-based vesting condition has been satisfied as of November 25, 2020 and based upon the assumed initial public offering price per share of $58.00, which is the midpoint of the price range set\nforth on the cover page of this prospectus. The amount of these obligations could be higher or lower, depending on the price of shares of our Class A common stock in this offering, and the actual number of pre-offering RSUs outstanding for which the\nservice-based vesting condition has been satisfied on the initial settlement date.\n\nCash Flows",

We generate substantially all of our revenue from facilitating guest stays at accommodations offered by hosts on the\nAirbnb platform. We consider both hosts and guests to be our customers.

Airbnb has always been a little\ndifferent, and as we take our company public, we feel compelled to tell you a little more about what makes Airbnb, Airbnb.\n\nWe started writing\nthis letter in March. Then the pandemic hit. When borders closed and travel stopped, our business declined by nearly 80%. We had to put our IPO on hold, and I don\u0092t think many people expected us to go public this year. I know some people\nquestioned if we\u0092d make it at all. What has transpired since then has been our most defining period since we started Airbnb.\n\nThey say that\na crisis has a way of revealing your true character. We would like to tell you about what this crisis revealed about who we are.\n\nFirst, our\nmodel is inherently adaptable. Over the summer, after months of being stuck inside their homes, people were yearning to connect with their loved ones in a safe way. They decided to get in their cars and travel close to home, often staying in small\ntowns and rural communities. Because we have millions of hosts who offer nearly all types of homes and experiences around the world, we were able to adapt to the new use cases guests wanted \u0097 from working remotely from another home, to taking\nextended trips with family and friends. Our business rebounded faster than anyone expected, and it showed that as the world changes, our model is able to adapt.\n\nThis crisis reinforced three truths that are even more core to who we are, and how we intend to operate for generations to come. As our prospective\ninvestors, we want to tell you about each.\n\nConnection and belonging\n\nWhen we started Airbnb, it was about more than just travel. In 2007, Joe and I were roommates in San Francisco, and we were trying to figure out\nhow to pay our rent. That weekend, a design conference was coming to San Francisco and hotels were sold out, so we inflated three airbeds and turned our apartment into an Airbed & Breakfast.

The connections we made that weekend led Joe and I to realize, \u0093Maybe there\u0092s a bigger idea here!\u0094 Soon after,\nNate joined, and we created a way for people around the world to be hosts, just like us.\n\nSince then, we\u0092ve grown from two hosts in San\nFrancisco to a community of over four million hosts all over the world. On the surface, what people come to Airbnb for is a new way to travel, but below the surface, what they find on Airbnb is connection. They experience a deeper connection to the\ncommunities they visit and the people who live there. This connection is delivered by our hosts, and they provide guests with a deeply personal experience \u0097 after all, guests are welcomed in their homes, and they live in their communities.\n\n\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, we knew we couldn\u0092t pursue everything that we used to. We chose to\nfocus on what is most unique about Airbnb \u0097 our core business of hosting. We got back to our roots and back to what is truly special about Airbnb \u0097 the everyday people who host their homes and offer experiences. We scaled back\ninvestments that did not directly support the core of our host community.\n\nThis focus came at the right time. People are feeling increasingly\ndisconnected in the world, and loneliness is pervading our society. The opposite of loneliness is belonging \u0097 the feeling of deep and genuine connection to a person, a place, or community. It\u0092s the feeling of being \u0093at home.\u0094 The\nfeeling of being known and loved.\n\nWe are a community based on connection and belonging, and we will continue to design new ways to provide for\nit.

We brought this creative spirit to Airbnb, and it\u0092s one of the most defining parts of our culture. We use our curiosity\nand imagination to come up with unconventional solutions. In fact, starting Airbnb was in itself a creative act \u0097 the biggest ideas are often leaps of the imagination.\n\nWhile we are dreamers, we are also pragmatic. At the center of being creatively-led is our design-driven approach. At Airbnb, design isn\u0092t just\nhow something looks, it\u0092s how it fundamentally works. We sit at the intersection of art and science, a commitment that started when Nate, an engineer, joined Joe and me. We used this approach to design a system of trust that allows strangers to\nlive together, and a unique business model that allows hosts to share in our success. And it\u0092s this approach that will continue to enable us to create new products and services that deliver connection, even beyond travel.\n\nIt is said that constraints breed creativity, and during the crisis our creatively-led approach was drawn on time and again to come up with\nunconventional solutions. Here are just a couple of examples:\n\nWith the onset of social distancing, we had to pause our\nin-person\nAirbnb Experiences, but in a matter of two weeks, our team pivoted the product to become Online Experiences \u0097 creating a new type of interactive experiences that connect people from all over the\nworld.",

In 2018, we set out to institutionalize our responsibility by defining a series of principles to serve each of our stakeholders. These principles were put to the ultimate test during the crisis.\n\nWhen travel stopped and borders closed, our guests needed to cancel their reservations, many of which were\n\nnon-refundable.\nIn the face of the pandemic, we issued more than $1 billion in refunds guided by our extenuating circumstances policy. While this helped our guests, it created problems for our hosts\n\u0097 half of whom depend on their Airbnb income to pay their rent or mortgage. For our hosts, we committed to pay up to $250 million to those impacted by cancellations. To protect our shareholders\u0092 investments, we significantly reduced",

Brian and Joe \u0097 two of our founders and friends from design school \u0097 were looking for a way to cover the cost of their\nSan Francisco apartment. That week, they saw an opportunity. An international design conference was coming to town, and every hotel was sold out. They quickly created a website, AirBedandBreakfast.com, with the hope of renting airbeds in their\napartment to attendees of the conference. Three designers, Michael, Kat, and Amol, took them up on their offer and became the first guests of Brian and Joe, our first hosts.",

But something unexpected happened that first weekend. Brian and Joe treated their guests like old friends from out of town, connecting them to a unique slice of San Francisco that they could never have experienced on their\nown. Michael, Kat, and Amol came as outsiders, but left feeling like locals. The experience left Brian and Joe feeling something special too \u0097 the excitement of sharing the city they loved and seeing their guests form a deep connection to it.\n\nBrian and Joe started thinking: maybe there were more people like Michael, Kat, and Amol who would like to travel this way and more people who\nwould like to host this way. These are the ideas that Airbnb was founded on.\n\nIn 2008, Nate, a software engineer, joined Brian and Joe, and\ntogether the three founders took on a bigger design problem: how do you make strangers feel comfortable enough to stay in each other\u0092s homes? The key was trust. The solution they designed combined host and guest profiles, integrated messaging,\ntwo-way\nreviews, and secure payments built on a technology platform that unlocked trust, and eventually led to hosting at a global scale that was unimaginable at the time.\n\n13 Years Later\n\nToday, the idea does not\nseem so crazy after all. Our more than 4 million hosts now offer everything from a private room in their home to luxury villas, from one night to several months at a time. Hosting has expanded from homes to now include experiences that can be\ntaken in cities all over the world, or even online. In more than 220 countries and regions around the world, our hosts have welcomed over 825 million guest arrivals and have cumulatively earned over $110 billion. \u0093Airbnb\u0094 has\nbecome synonymous with\none-of-a-kind\ntravel on a global scale.",

And it is through this connection that people can experience a greater sense of belonging. This is at the root of what brought people to Airbnb and is what continues to bring people back.\n\n\n\nA New Category\n\nTravel is one of the world\u0092s largest industries, and its approach has become commoditized. The travel industry has scaled by offering\nstandardized accommodations in crowded hotel districts and frequently-visited landmarks and attractions. This\none-size-fits-all\n\napproach has limited how much of the world a person can access, and as a result, guests are often left feeling like outsiders in the places they visit.\n\nAirbnb has enabled home sharing at a global scale and created a new category of travel. Instead of traveling like tourists and feeling like outsiders,\nguests on Airbnb can stay in neighborhoods where people live, have authentic experiences, live like locals, and spend time with locals in approximately 100,000 cities around the world. In our early days, we described this new type of travel with the\ntagline \u0093Travel like a human.\u0094 Today, people simply refer to it with a single word: \u0093Airbnb.\u0094\n\nHosting is at the Center\n\nHosting is the foundation of the Airbnb experience. Airbnb enables hosts to provide guests access to a vast world of unique homes and\nexperiences that were previously inaccessible, or even undiscovered. The role of the host is about more than opening their door. A great host enables guests to find a deeper connection to the places they visit and the people who live there.",

A great host enables guests to find a deeper connection to the places they visit and the people who live there.\n\nOur community of hosts started by sharing their spare bedrooms on Airbnb in a few large cities. Soon, hosts listed entire homes, cabins, treehouses,\nboats, castles, and luxury villas \u0097 practically any space that you could think of \u0097 in big cities, small towns, and rural communities in nearly every corner of the world.\n\nOnce there were millions of homes on Airbnb, we recognized that hosts could share not only their homes but also their interests and talents. From\nexploring graffiti art in New York to finding hidden jazz clubs in London, Airbnb Experiences offer authentic activities in over 1,000 cities around the world.\n\nWe believe that we have just scratched the surface of the opportunities that hosting provides. There are many more ways people will want to connect\nwith each other and the world around them, and so we will continue to design and enable new ways to host. No matter what form it takes, hosting will be at the center of Airbnb.\n\nGuests are Members of Our Community\n\nOur\nhosts have welcomed hundreds of millions of guest arrivals through Airbnb. Our guests are not transactions \u0097 they are engaged, contributing members of our community.\n\nOnce they become a part of Airbnb, guests actively participate in our community, return regularly to our platform to book again, and recommend Airbnb\nto others who then join themselves. This demand encourages new hosts to join, which in turn attracts even more guests. It is a virtuous cycle \u0097 guests attract hosts, and hosts attract guests.\n\nA Resilient Model\n\nIn early 2020, as\nCOVID-19\ndisrupted travel across the world, Airbnb\u0092s business declined significantly.

But within two months, our business model started to rebound even with limited international travel, demonstrating its\nresilience. People wanted to get out of their homes and yearned to travel, but they did not want to go far or to be in crowded hotel lobbies. Domestic travel quickly rebounded on Airbnb around the world as millions of guests took trips closer to\nhome. Stays of longer than a few days started increasing as work-from-home became\nwork-from-any-home\non Airbnb. We believe that the lines between travel and living are\nblurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere. Our platform has proven adaptable to serve these new ways of traveling.\n\n\n\nAnd just as when Airbnb started during the Great Recession of 2008, we believe that people will\ncontinue to turn to hosting to earn extra income. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do not believe it is possible to predict COVID-19\u0092s cumulative and ultimate impact on our\nfuture business, results of operations, and financial condition. COVID-19 has materially adversely affected our recent operating and financial results and is continuing to materially adversely impact our long-term operating and financial results.\nHowever, we believe that as the world recovers from this pandemic, Airbnb will be a vital source of economic empowerment for millions of people.\n\nServing Our Stakeholders\n\nAirbnb has five\nstakeholders and is designed with all of them in mind.

We consider a listing of a home or an experience to be an active listing if it is viewable on Airbnb and has been previously booked at least once on Airbnb. In 2019, 84% of our revenue resulted from stays with\nexisting hosts who had completed at least one guest check-in on or before December 31, 2018.

In 2019, we added more hosts than\nany year in our history with 23% of our new hosts first starting out as guests on Airbnb.\n\nOur hosts generally fall into two categories:\nindividual and professional. Individual hosts are those who activate their listings directly on Airbnb through our website or mobile apps. Professional hosts are often those who run property management or hospitality businesses and generally use\napplication programming interfaces to list their properties on our platform.\n\nIndividual hosts are the core of our host community.

In addition, according to a survey we conducted in May and June 2020, 9 out of 10 hosts surveyed said that they\nintend to continue hosting at least as often as before the COVID-19 pandemic when and where it is safe to do so.\n\nHost Endowment Fund\n\nWe have established a Host Endowment Fund that is designed to allow our hosts to share in the success of our business. The goal of the Host\nEndowment Fund is to support and benefit our host community through a variety of potential programs, initiatives, and grants. We want hosts to share in our success, not merely for a single moment in time, but for as long as Airbnb exists in the\nworld. We intend the Host Endowment Fund to\n\n\n\nbe a long-term investment in the future of our host community, to be shaped by hosts for hosts.

They seek everything from budget stays to luxury accommodations in large cities to remote villages. What they often have in common is a curiosity about the world and open-mindedness\nto other people and cultures. While Airbnb is popular across people of all ages, we are particularly strong with younger travelers: as of September 30, 2020, the majority of our guests who have ever made a booking on Airbnb were between the\nages of 18 and 34. Our high level of guest satisfaction is evidenced by 82% of guest reviews during the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 having a\n5-star\noverall rating.\n\nIn 2019, 54 million active bookers worldwide booked 327 million nights and experiences on our platform, and since our founding, there have\nbeen over 825 million guest arrivals on Airbnb. Guest arrivals represent an individual and all co-travelers included on a reservation for a stay for completed check-ins during a given period. Because an individual guest may take more than one\ntrip in a measurement period for guest arrivals, such guest will be counted separately for each check-in when calculating total guest arrivals for a period. In comparison, a check-in represents a check-in event for a single reservation for a stay or\nexperience, regardless of the number of travelers or experience participants.\n\nMost of our guests discover Airbnb organically, with approximately\n91% of all traffic to Airbnb coming through direct or unpaid channels during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Guests are highly engaged and contribute value for hosts and other guests: over 68% of guests left reviews of their stays in",

Going forward, as the travel environment continues to recover from the impact of COVID-19, we have implemented a marketing strategy that will shift our marketing mix more towards brand marketing\nspend and away from spending on performance marketing. In future periods, we anticipate that the increase in brand marketing spend from 2019 levels will be less than the reduction in performance marketing spend from 2019 levels. As a result, we\nexpect to have lower total sales and marketing expense in 2021, in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue, relative to 2019.\n\nAs we shift our\npaid investments to brand marketing and focus our internal resources to strengthen the infrastructure that supports our unpaid channels, we are expecting our visitor mix to shift further toward direct and unpaid channels, which represented 77% of\ntraffic in 2019 and has shifted to approximately 91% of traffic in the first nine months of 2020. Based on our analysis of our performance marketing spend in 2019 and our results to date in 2020, we believe this strategy will allow us to maintain or\nincrease overall traffic levels with lower performance marketing spend.

Just like their time together at design school, they envisioned a close-knit community that accepted people in all of their eccentricities and allowed them to be themselves, inspiring them to do\ntheir best, most creative work. But Airbnb is not just a creative culture. We sit at the intersection of art and science, a commitment that started when Nate, an engineer, joined Brian and Joe, both designers. It is this marriage of art and science\n\u0097 of the scientific method with the creative process \u0097 that produces work that captures people\u0092s imaginations.\n\nOur culture is\noptimistic, with people who are passionate about our mission, caring about others, and curious about the world.

Just as discrimination\nexists in society, it exists in the Airbnb community, and we are committed to combating it. In 2016, we began taking steps to address discrimination on Airbnb.\n\nFirst, we created the Airbnb Nondiscrimination Policy, which we required every host and guest to agree to in order to use Airbnb. If a host or guest\ndoes not agree to the policy, they are removed from our platform. Since 2016, approximately 1.4 million people have been removed from Airbnb for declining to agree to this policy.\n\nNext, we did a comprehensive review of our platform and instituted the following initial measures:\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | We created an anti-discrimination team of technical professionals that work to fight bias and\ndiscrimination;\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | We changed the way we show profile photos so hosts only see a guest\u0092s photo after a reservation is\nconfirmed; and\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | We distributed an antiracism guide to our hosts and guests in the United States.\n[/TABLE]\n\nMost recently, in June 2020, we launched Project Lighthouse, our most significant leap forward in battling discrimination.

Project Lighthouse will measure discrimination on Airbnb based on perception. These perceptions will be aggregated and used to identify and measure discrepancies in people\u0092s\nexperiences that could be the result of discrimination.

The GDPR regulates a broad array of personal data that can directly or indirectly identify an individual and imposes stringent data protection\nrequirements with significant penalties for noncompliance. Many large geographies, which are important to our success, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and India, have passed or are in the process of passing comparable data privacy\nlegislation or regulations.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce continue to call for greater\nregulation of the collection of personal data, as well as restrictions for certain targeted advertising practices. Numerous states have enacted or are in the process of enacting state level data privacy laws and regulations governing the collection,\nuse, and processing of state residents\u0092 personal data. For example, the CCPA went into effect in California on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours and requires us to modify our\ndata processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act of 2020, which further expands the CCPA with additional data privacy\ncompliance requirements and establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing those requirements.",

Specifically, the number of options and RSUs granted\nwere determined by converting the annual target grant values using a value that was 27.3% higher than the fair value on the date of grant. The exercise price for options was also set at a 27.3% premium to the fair market value of our common stock on\nthe date of grant. Accordingly, these actions resulted in grants covering 27.3% fewer shares than our historical approach would have otherwise produced.\n[/TABLE]\n\nFounder Compensation Changes\n\nIn\npreparing for the initial public offering of our common stock, in November 2020, our board of directors made significant changes intended to provide a meaningful incentive to our founders for their continued leadership of our company.\n\nBrian Chesky",

Under Mr. Chesky\u0092s leadership over the last decade, the company\u0092s revenues have grown to $4.8 billion in 2019, and the board of directors believes that it is important to continue to retain and motivate Mr. Chesky to\nlead the company over the next decade based on this history of exceptional performance. Our board of directors intends for the Multi-Year Award to be the exclusive equity award that Mr. Chesky receives through the 10th anniversary of the date of\ngrant. The size of the Multi-Year Award, which has a grant-date fair value of approximately $120.0 million and implied yearly earnings potential of approximately $12.0 million per year over the ten years the Multi-Year Award is eligible to vest, was\ndetermined in light of the median annualized long-term incentive values from the most recent competitive peer group study of approximately $19 million per year.

In 2019, our board of directors engaged with Semler Brossy Consulting Group (\u0093Semler Brossy\u0094), an independent compensation consultant, to formalize a set of principles\nto guide our compensation program design and decisions. To summarize these principles:\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Long-term alignment.Performance measurement, incentive goals, and individual performance\nassessments all clearly align with and support our long-term vision and alignment with stakeholders. They encourage a long-term timeframe, while acknowledging the competitive talent market realities.\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Ownership.We believe in the power of an owner\u0092s mindset.

We also entered into a severance agreement with Mr. Greeley in\nconnection with his separation from us effective August 1, 2020 and a board transition letter with Ms. Johnson in connection with her transition from our Chief Operating Officer to a\nnon-employee",

In addition, pledging of Airbnb stock by executive officers and members of the board of directors as collateral for loans and investments is prohibited absent approval by\nthe board of directors and in no event shall such pledge exceed 5% of the outstanding shares of company securities held by such officer or director and such loan exceed an aggregate amount of $30 million. In addition, in no event may any pledge\noccur before the 18-month anniversary of the closing of the offering to which this prospectus relates.\n\nClawback Policy\n\nWe have adopted a clawback policy that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, each other executive officer and certain other key employees. The\npolicy applies in the event our publicly disclosed financial statements are required to be restated as a result of fraudulent or willful misconduct and provides the Leadership Development, Belonging and Compensation Committee or the board of\ndirectors with the discretion to recover cash incentives, equity awards or other compensation of at-fault employees.\n\nExecutive Stock\nOwnership Policy",

Employees covered by the policy are required to hold a number of shares of common stock equal to: (i) for our Chief Executive Officer, ten times his annual base salary and (ii) for each other executive officer and\nkey employee, five times his or her annual base salary. Under the policy, until a covered employee has reached the minimum ownership guideline, 50% of the shares acquired pursuant to company equity awards (net of taxes) must be held by such\nemployee.\n\nTax and Accounting Considerations\n\nAs a general matter, our board of directors reviews and considers the various tax and accounting implications of compensation programs we utilize.\n\nDeductibility of Executive Compensation\n. Section 162(m) of the Code denies a publicly-traded corporation a federal income tax\ndeduction for remuneration in excess of $1 million per year per person paid to executives designated in Section 162(m) of the Code, including, but not limited to, its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and the next three\nhighly compensated executive officers. However, we believe that maintaining the discretion to provide compensation that is\nnon-deductible\nallows us to\n\n\n\nprovide compensation tailored to the needs of our company and our named executive officers and is an important part of our responsibilities and benefits our stockholders.\n\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\n.

It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests, including\ntransactions that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares.\n\nThese provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage\ncoercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection\nof our potential ability to negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because negotiation of these proposals could result in an\nimprovement of their terms.\n\nMulti-Series Stock\n\nAs described above in the subsection titled \u0093 \u0097 Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class H Common Stock \u0097 Voting\nRights,\u0094 our restated certificate of incorporation will continue to provide for a multi-series common stock structure, which will provide our founders, current investors, executives, and employees with significant influence over all matters\nrequiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets.\n\n\n\nUndesignated Preferred Stock",

The Company regularly evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debt reserves, fair value of investments, useful lives of long-lived\nassets and intangible assets, valuation of acquired goodwill and intangible assets from acquisitions, contingent liabilities, insurance reserves, revenue recognition, valuation of common stock, stock-based compensation, and income and\nnon-income\ntaxes, among others.

The expense recognition and cash flow treatment arising from a finance lease and operating lease by a lessee have not changed significantly\nfrom previous U.S. GAAP. For operating leases, a lessee is required to do the following: (i) recognize a ROU asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, on the consolidated balance sheets;\n(ii) recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, generally on a straight-line basis; and (iii) classify all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash\nflows. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019.\n\nThe adoption of the standard had a material impact on the Company\u0092s\nfinancial statements, with the most significant effects related to: (i) the recognition of new ROU assets and lease liabilities on the Company\u0092s consolidated balance sheets for its real estate and data center operating leases;\n(ii) the derecognition of existing assets and liabilities for certain sale-leaseback transactions (arising from\nbuild-to-suit\nlease arrangements); (iii) the\nderecognition of existing assets and liabilities for certain assets constructed under\nbuild-to-suit\nlease arrangements that the Company subsequently leased; (iv) no",

For assets held at amortized cost basis, the guidance eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold and instead requires an entity to\nreflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For\navailable-for-sale debt securities, credit losses are recorded through an allowance for credit losses, rather than a write-down, limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. Additional disclosures about significant estimates\nand credit quality are also required. For public companies, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.

The Company will continue to monitor the application and interpretation of lodging and related taxes and ordinances and will\nadjust accruals based on any new information or further developments.\n\nThe Company is under audit and inquiry by various domestic and foreign tax\nauthorities with regard to\nnon-income\ntax matters. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities primarily arises from the Company\u0092s transactions with its hosts and guests, as well as the tax\ntreatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with hosts and guests, disputes involve the applicability of transactional taxes (such as sales, value-added, and similar\ntaxes) to services provided, as well as the applicability of withholding tax on payments made to such hosts. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcomes may\nexceed the estimated liabilities recorded. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020 (unaudited), the Company recorded $61.0 million of tax expense, $49.6 million of tax",
