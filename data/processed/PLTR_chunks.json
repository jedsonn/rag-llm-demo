So long as our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement and certain of their affiliates collectively\nmeet a minimum ownership threshold on the applicable record date for a vote of the stockholders, the Class F common stock, together with the Founder Voting Trust Agreement and the Founder Voting Agreement, will give these Founders the ability to\ncontrol up to 49.999999% of the total voting power of our capital stock, and the Founders may, in certain circumstances, in the future, have voting power that, in the aggregate, exceeds 49.999999%.

However, our shares of Class A common stock (on an\nas-converted\nbasis) have a history of trading in private transactions. Based on information available to us, the low and high sales prices per share of Class A common stock (on an\n\nas-converted\nbasis) for such private transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019 were $4.50 and $6.50, respectively, and during the period from January 1, 2020 through September 1,\n2020 were $4.17 and $11.50, respectively. The volume weighted-average price per share for the period from January 1, 2020 through September 1, 2020 was $6.02. For more information, see the section titled \u0093\nSale Price History of Our\nCapital Stock\n.\u0094 Our recent trading prices in private transactions may have little or no relation to the opening public price of our shares of Class A common stock on the NYSE or the subsequent trading price of our shares of\nClass A common stock on the NYSE. Further, the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE without underwriters is a novel method for commencing public trading in shares of our Class A common stock, and consequently, the trading\nvolume and price of shares of our Class A common stock may be more volatile than if shares of our Class A common stock were initially listed in connection with an underwritten IPO.\n\nBased on information provided by the NYSE, the opening public price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE will be determined by buy and\nsell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers. Based on such orders, the designated market maker (\u0093DMM\u0094) will determine an opening price for our Class A common stock in consultation with a financial advisor pursuant to\napplicable NYSE rules.

Packaged software tends to be designed to meet standardized needs. But commoditized\nsolutions are only sufficient when keeping up with the market \u0097 that is, beta \u0097 is the goal. When it is time to generate differentiated value \u0097 that is, alpha \u0097 we believe that typical packaged software falls short.

A company\nseeking to capitalize on its unique resources or to uncover a need unmet by its competitors requires more than software that simply conforms to well-defined best practices.\n\nBuy or Build\n\nIn\nthe search for differentiation, institutions often resort to a default approach: attempting to coordinate the construction of a custom solution themselves. They enlist the help of consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open source\nsoftware, and sizable internal IT resources.\n\nSome custom IT and software efforts reach completion. But even in these cases, finishing a\nproject on time does not guarantee enduring value. Such projects typically entail stitching together individual solutions with custom code and forcing them to interoperate. Every new piece of the patchwork opens new avenues for failure down the\nroad.\n\nEmbrace Complexity or Resist It\n\nThe largest and most complex undertakings when it comes to data integration and analysis, where the risk of failure is highest, also offer the\ngreatest potential return. Across industries, institutions with decades of experience are competing to overcome decades of fragmented IT investments. We have repeatedly seen that institutions that use data to transform their core operations are the\nones that win.\n\nChallenges\n\nBuilding and deploying enterprise software are among the most significant challenges our customers face.\n\nMost Data Integration and Analytical Projects Fall Short\n\nOrganizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms before turning to buy ours. Government agencies and commercial enterprises\noften experiment with single-purpose tools and custom software solutions for specific workflows such as customer relationship management and financial planning. Each new tool or application creates a new silo within an already fragmented data\nlandscape.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to making operational decisions, institutions are left to invest significant\ntime and resources in attempting to unify their data.",

When a new\nquestion arises, the process begins again.\n\nFixing a Legacy System Can Be as Expensive as Building One from Scratch\n\nAs organizations grow and change, their legacy technology often fails to keep up. Each pivot requires flexibility, and some systems simply\nlack it. Institutions often have to start over as each aging system becomes obsolete.\n\nInstead of Enabling Collaboration, Many\nSoftware Security Models Preclude It Altogether\n\nWhen an institution\u0092s data systems are fragmented, deploying a security\nmodel that functions effectively can be costly, if not prohibitively expensive. In order for an enterprise data platform to effectively power an institution\u0092s operations, security systems must be built in from the start. Security features\nshould always follow a piece of data from its source system to final state.

For example, in November 2019, we created a jointly controlled entity in Japan with SOMPO Holdings, Inc. We believe this arrangement offers our business strategic operational advantages within the Japanese market, but it also\nlimits our ability to independently sell our platforms, provide certain services, engage certain customers, or compete in Japanese markets or industry verticals, which limits our opportunities for growth in Japan and, depending on the success of the\nentity, may negatively impact our results.

(\u0093Airbus\u0094) that, over time, developed into the Skywise platform partnership, which provides our business strategic\nadvantages but also limits our ability to independently provide our platforms to certain airlines and companies that compete with Airbus.",

If such security has lesser economic rights, it could have the effect of further\nincreasing the divergence between the economic interests of our Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement, on the one hand, and the voting power of such Founders, on the other. Further, Corporation Equity Securities includes, among\nother things, any warrants, calls, options or other right, whether vested or unvested, to acquire from the Company certain voting or equity securities from the Company. Accordingly, the Board of Directors could issue additional equity securities, or\nadditional options, RSUs, warrants or other rights to acquire equity securities (whether vested or unvested), to our Founders, which would increase the number of Corporation Equity Securities they hold and enable them to meet the Ownership Threshold\nnotwithstanding sales of Corporation Equity Securities that they currently hold. As a result, any Founders who are then party to the Founder Voting Agreement could hold a nominal equity interest with little to no voting rights but meet the Ownership\nThreshold and therefore have voting power that provides effective control of our company.\n\nThe multiple class structure of our\ncommon stock features certain provisions that are novel or otherwise not common among other corporations with multiple class structures.",

Based on the number of RSUs\nthen outstanding and the vesting schedules then in effect, as of August 31, 2020, we expect that approximately 8.0 million, 10.9 million, and 11.0 million RSUs will vest on November 20, 2020, February 20, 2021, and May 20, 2021, respectively.\nShares of common stock received upon the vesting and settlement of RSUs will not be subject to the lock-up agreements entered into between us and certain of our security holders and may be sold at any time, subject to compliance with applicable\nsecurities laws and, if applicable, our insider trading policies.\n\nIf the market price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE is volatile\nor if there is an oversupply of shares of Class A common stock and holders of RSUs are unable to sell their shares, holders of RSUs would still be responsible for funding the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the",

Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\n\nOverview\n\nWe founded the\ncompany in 2003 to build software for use in counterterrorism operations.\n\nIn 2008, we released our first platform, Palantir Gotham\n(\u0093Gotham\u0094), for customers in the intelligence sector. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants.\n\nDefense agencies in the United States then began using Gotham to investigate potential threats and to help protect soldiers from improvised\nexplosive devices. Today, the platform is widely used by government agencies in the United States and its allies. Our software is on the front lines, sometimes literally, and that means so are we.\n\nWe later began working with leading companies across industries, including companies in the energy, transportation, financial services, and\nhealthcare sectors. In 2016, we released our second software platform, Palantir Foundry (\u0093Foundry\u0094), to address a common set of challenges that we saw at large companies.\n\nFoundry is becoming a central operating system not only for individual institutions but also for entire industries.\n\nIn 2017, for example, our partnership with Airbus expanded into a platform for the aviation industry, and today connects data from more than\none hundred airlines and 9,000 aircraft around the world.\n\nWe believe that every large institution faces challenges that our platforms\nwere designed to address. Our focus in the near term is to build partnerships with institutions that have the leadership necessary to effect structural change within their organizations \u0097 to reconstitute their operations around data.

A more detailed discussion of the three phases, for\npurposes of illustration of how we manage accounts across the business, follows below.\n\nAcquire\n\nWe actively pursue discussions with existing and prospective customers in order to identify ways in which our software platforms can provide\nlong-term value.\n\nIn the first phase, we typically acquire new opportunities with minimal risk to our customers through short-term pilot\ndeployments of our software platforms at no or low cost to them. We believe in proving the value of our platforms to our customers. During these short-term pilots, we operate the accounts at a loss.

Customers may make nominal payments in connection with the evaluation of our software that we do not consider material in evaluating the\nperformance of our accounts.\n\nWe evaluate the success of customer accounts in the Acquire phase based on the revenue such accounts\ngenerate in the following year. In 2019, we generated $0.6 million in revenue from customers in the Acquire phase, which yielded a contribution loss of $65.4 million. In H1 2020, those same customers generated $18.8 million in revenue, which yielded\na contribution loss of $13.9 million.

In times\nof crisis, our software can help an institution survive \u0097 whether the crisis is local, that is, specific to a customer\u0092s organization, or global in nature.\n\nOur company was founded in the wake of the attacks on September 11th. Other periods of geopolitical turmoil have followed, including the\nglobal financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the ISIS terrorist attacks across Europe in 2015 and 2016. The current pandemic is only the latest challenge we face. Our software has been critical in helping governments and companies around the world to\nrespond to each of these crises.\n\nCompanies and government agencies have also turned to us and our software when specific challenges, such\nas a manufacturing problem on the assembly line or a breach of internal systems, affect their operations. Institutions rely on our software to navigate broader competitive challenges as well, even existential ones, in the markets or sectors in which\nthey operate.\n\nGovernment Contracts\n\nOur partnerships with government agencies in the United States and abroad have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our\nbusiness.",

We define contribution margin as revenue less our cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, divided by revenue. At the end of each year, we categorize each customer account into\none of the three phases based on its revenue and contribution margin for that year.\n\nRevenue is allocated to each customer account\ndirectly. The cost of revenue and sales and marketing costs include both the costs associated with the deployment and operation of our software as well as expenses associated with identifying new customers and expanding partnerships with existing\nones. Our software engineers working with existing customers often manage the deployment and operation of our platforms as well as identify new ways that those platforms can be used. To calculate the contribution by customer, we allocate cost of\nrevenue and sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, to an account pro rata based on headcount and time spent on the account during the period. To the extent certain costs or personnel are not directly assigned to a specific\naccount, they are allocated pro rata based on total headcount staffed during such period.

To the extent costs of revenue or sales and marketing expenses are not\ndirectly attributable to a particular segment, they are allocated based upon headcount at each segment during the period. We use it, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, each of our segments. It excludes certain\noperating expenses that are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the consolidated corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation expense, research and development costs, and general and\nadministrative costs, such as legal and accounting.

The increase in expenses was primarily\ndue to increases of $6.4 million in personnel costs, including travel-related expenses, and $7.9 million for professional services related to corporate functions including legal and finance, and $0.7 million in other allocated overhead.\nSuch increases are primarily driven by an increase in headcount and costs for existing headcount, as well as initiatives to support the overall growth of our operations. However, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue\ndecreased to 43% in 2019 from 51% in 2018.

In\ncertain instances we have experienced a decline in revenue in the three months ended March 31 followed by sequential increases in revenue throughout the year as a result of the timing of when contracts are executed and the period of performance\nbegins. However, the growth in revenue from new contracts executed towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 offset this decline in the first quarter of 2020. Because we recognize the majority of our revenue ratably over the contractual term, a\nsubstantial portion of revenue recognized each period is from agreements that we entered into during previous periods. As such, increases or decreases in contracts with new or existing customers may not immediately be reflected as revenue for that\nperiod.\n\nQuarterly Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Trends\n\nOur cost of revenue increased sequentially in each of the quarterly periods presented through the three months ended December 31, 2019.

A company seeking to capitalize on its unique\nresources or to uncover a need unmet by its competitors requires more than software that simply conforms to well-defined best practices.\n\nBuy or Build\n\nIn\nthe search for differentiation, institutions often resort to a default approach: attempting to coordinate the construction of a custom solution themselves. They enlist the help of consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source\nsoftware, and sizable internal IT resources.\n\nSome custom IT and software efforts reach completion. But even in these cases finishing a\nproject on time does not guarantee enduring value.

Each new tool or application creates a new silo within an already fragmented data landscape.\n\nWhen it comes to making operational decisions, institutions are left to invest significant time and resources in attempting to unify their\ndata. It is common, for example, for employees across different business functions to spend weeks assembling data across disparate systems into a static PDF sent around by email.\n\nBy the time a question is answered, the underlying data may be stale. When a new question arises, the process begins again.\n\nEven more ambitious projects that venture beyond the adoption of single-purpose tools often fall short.

We\nbelieve that this broader shift in government procurement will be a significant factor in our ability to capture an even greater share of our TAM, given that the purchase of our platforms can be funded through either information technology,\noperational, or other government budgets. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense will spend an estimated $144 billion in fiscal year 2020 on procurement and $105 billion on research, development, testing, and evaluation. We believe\nthat our software is relevant and can contribute to programs covered by both of those budgets.\n\nOur victory in federal court has already\nhad a significant impact on our business. We generated a total of $51.9 million in revenue from our U.S. Army accounts from 2008 through September 2018, when the federal court ruled in our favor. After the ruling, in less than two years,\nbetween October 2018 and June 2020, we generated $134.5 million in revenue from those accounts.",

Government procurement offices paid preferred suppliers for years, if not\ndecades, to develop bespoke software. And commercial suppliers struggled to justify entering the federal market.\n\nThe regulations involved\nseemed too esoteric, and the market too dominated by incumbents who knew how to maneuver within the system to their advantage.

This is made possible by our software\u0092s access controls, which enable agencies to work on the same platform simultaneously and securely.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nOur\napproach to sales and marketing is built around the first two phases of our business model, as described in the section titled \u0093\nManagement\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation \u0097 Our Business\nModel\n\u0094: customer acquisition (in the Acquire phase) and account growth (in the Expand phase).\n\nCustomer Acquisition",

The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the\nlong sales cycles associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition. The larger, more complex, and more technologically demanding the problem, the more likely we are to succeed.\n\nAcross both the public and private sectors, there is a history of failures when investing in new technologies. One U.S. military department\nspent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.\n\nMany of our customers have had similar experiences investing millions \u0097 even billions \u0097 of dollars in digital transformation\nprojects, enterprise data warehouses, and digital twin initiatives that never really worked.\n\nThese failures have made both software\nbuyers and vendors highly risk-averse. Institutions often doubt that any vendor can implement a working solution and are unwilling to invest. On the other hand, smaller technology companies are often unable to compete for complex, large-scale\nopportunities because installation costs and the risks of failure are too high, and the sales cycles too long.\n\nThese are precisely the\nopportunities we target. Rather than reject projects with risky and resource intensive installation requirements, we actively seek them out.\n\nAccelerating Customer Acquisition\n\nThere\nare a number of sales and marketing strategies that have accelerated our ability to acquire customers in recent years.\n\nDirect Sales Force\n\nWe are investing in an account-based sales force to identify new customers and opportunities.",

We will continue to expand headcount in our direct sales force.\n\nSector and Industry Platforms\n\nWe are\ndeveloping industry operating systems to help companies and government agencies manage operations across their entire organizations. These operating systems allow our software to be distributed at scale to institutions within given industries.\n\nFor example, Skywise is our aviation platform that we have developed in partnership with Airbus. Our approach with Airbus involves a\ncollaborative\ngo-to-market\nstrategy to distribute the Foundry platform across the aviation industry. The adoption of our software has been swift. Since June 2017,\nSkywise has expanded from zero to more than one hundred airlines on the platform. Each one is now an existing or potential customer.\n\nWe\nare working on similar partnerships in the insurance, healthcare, automotive, and government sectors, which we anticipate will have a significant impact on our business moving forward.\n\nU.S. Government\n\nWe intend to capture an\neven greater share of U.S. federal government spending on software systems, following our legal victory in federal court. The ruling requires the government to consider commercially available products, such as our software, before attempting to\nbuild its own.\n\nWe generated a total of $51.9 million in revenue from our U.S. Army accounts from 2008 through September 2018, when\nthe federal court ruled in our favor. After the ruling, in less than two years, between October 2018 and June 2020, we generated $134.5 million in revenue from those accounts.\n\nChannel Sales & Cloud Partnerships",

We formed Palantir Japan to deploy our platforms across commercial and governmental institutions in the Japanese market.\n\nIn 2020, EMD Digital Inc., an affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and Palantir launched a joint partnership called Syntropy to\naccelerate cancer research through secure collaboration within the global scientific community.\n\nAccount Growth\n\nThere are a number of sales and marketing strategies that we use to drive revenue growth at an account.\n\n\n\nThese strategies include (1) creating new ecosystem partnerships to extend the platform\nbeyond the customer\u0092s four walls into the operations of its partners and suppliers, (2) selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities, and (3) selling strategic implementations of our software against specific\nuse cases, which deliver competitive differentiation.",

The below table excludes sales of our redeemable convertible preferred stock and convertible preferred stock for the indicated periods, but includes such\nshares on an as-converted to common stock basis in the number of shares outstanding.

    "text": "t listing may have less information available to it to determine the opening public price of our Class A common stock than a DMM would in an underwritten initial public offering. For example, because\nour financial advisors are not acting as underwriters, they will not have engaged in a book building process, and as a result, they will not be able to provide input to the DMM that is based on or informed by that process. Moreover, prior to the\nopening trade, there will not be a price at which underwriters initially sold shares of Class A common stock to the public as there would be in an underwritten initial public offering. This lack of an initial public offering price could impact\nthe range of buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from various broker-dealers. Consequently, the public price of our Class A common stock may be more volatile than in an underwritten initial public offering and could, upon listing on the\nNYSE, decline significantly and rapidly.

The Company has elected the practical expedient allowing the Company to not disclose remaining performance obligations for contracts with original\nterms of twelve months or less.

Income Taxes\n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of the annual\neffective tax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, it will record a cumulative adjustment in such period. The Company\u0092s interim tax provision, and estimate of its annual effective tax rate, is subject to variation due\nto several factors, including variability in\npre-tax\nincome (or loss), the mix of jurisdictions to which such income relates, and tax law developments in the jurisdiction where the Company conducts business.\nThe Company\u0092s estimated annual effective tax rate for the year differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% as a result of its U.S. losses for which no benefit will be realized, as well as its foreign operations which are subject to tax rates\nthat differ from those in the U.S.\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u0093the CARES Act\u0094) was enacted on\nMarch 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, including delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and estimated\nincome tax payments that we are deferring to future periods. The Company does not currently expect the CARES Act to have a material impact on its financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on its liquidity. The\nCompany will continue to monitor and assess the impact the CARES Act and similar legislation in other countries may have on its business and financial results.",
