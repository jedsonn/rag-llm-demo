Like many immigrants, my family came to this country to pursue the American Dream. Dad came to pursue a Ph.D. in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Illinois at\nUrbana-Champaign. Mom hoped she could retain her job as a doctor, her occupation in China, but the odds were against her. The United States didn\u0092t recognize her Chinese medical license and with only $250 to our family\u0092s name, putting her\nthrough school again was impossible. But that didn\u0092t stop her.\n\nMom put food on the table by working three jobs a day for 12 years. One of\nthose jobs was as a server at a local Chinese restaurant, where I got a front row seat as a dishwasher. For Mom, working at a restaurant was a means to an end. After deferring her dreams for more than a decade, she saved enough money to return to\nschool and open her medical clinic, which she still runs more than 20 years later.\n\nDoorDash exists today to empower those like my Mom who came here\nwith a dream to make it on their own. Fighting for the underdog is part of who I am and what we stand for as a company. Having spoken to countless merchants since DoorDash\u0092s founding in 2013\u0097from a Mom and Pop store like Oren\u0092s Hummus\nto the General Managers of Chili\u0092s (aka \u0093ChiliHeads\u0094)\u0097I am humbled by their relentless drive to create and build, and their contribution to their communities. While small businesses are vital to our communities and created\napproximately two-thirds of net new jobs in the United States from 2000 to 2018,\nthey now risk being left behind in the convenience economy where consumers have become accustomed to obtaining\neverything in a few clicks, a trend that has only accelerated in a COVID world.

Helping brick-and-mortar businesses compete, succeed, and flourish in these rapidly changing times is the core problem we are trying to solve.\n\nThe Future of \u0093Local\u0094 \u0097 Our Unique Opportunity\n\nDoorDash has always been about helping local businesses succeed, more so than about food delivery. As students at Stanford, we canvassed the Bay Area\nasking dozens of local businesses what they needed to grow their business. When they shared the challenges related to delivery, we were surprised. Delivery was not a new idea, yet outside of New York City in the United States, very few businesses\noffered it. Seven years ago, we could not have imagined how big a transformation this would become, and we are still in the early innings of this evolution of local commerce.\n\nWhile we started by enabling food delivery, our plan is to build products that transform the way local merchants do business and enrich the communities\nin which they operate. Over time, we will build three mutually-reinforcing assets to enable this vision:\n\n[TABLE]\n1. | An on-demand logistics platform that can facilitate the local delivery of any item\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n2. | Merchant services to grow sales in the modern era\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n3. | A membership program to the physical world for consumers\n[/TABLE]\n\nLogistics\n\nIf we can make possible the\ndelivery of ice cream before it melts, or pizza before it gets cold, or groceries in an hour, we can make the on-demand delivery of anything within a city a reality. We started with restaurants because of the potential to build the most efficient\nlogistics network with the highest\n\n[TABLE]\n1 | U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, or SBA, Frequently Asked Questions, September 2019.

We believe that by starting with food, we have created the most sophisticated and reliable\nlogistics platform for local businesses. And, while food itself is a category that has a long runway for growth, we believe the network we have built ideally positions us to fulfill our vision of empowering all local businesses to compete in the\nconvenience economy.\n\nMerchant Services\n\nLogistics alone, however, will not help physical businesses compete. How do you acquire customers in a world where they no longer walk inside your\nstores? What products should you make today and in the future? How should you price your products? How do you build customer relationships over time?\n\nDoorDash is much more than an application that connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers by facilitating delivery. We provide a broad array of services\nthat enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support, and to fulfill demand generated through their own channels. This is\njust the beginning\u0097we strive to become a merchant\u0092s first call when they want to grow their business.\n\nMembership Program\n\nOver time, as DoorDash partners with local businesses beyond restaurants, we want to make it easy and affordable for consumers to enjoy the best of their\ncommunities. To that end, we launched a membership program called DashPass, where customers can pay a flat monthly delivery fee (today $9.99) for unlimited deliveries from eligible merchants.

In the future, we envision this membership program becoming a wallet for the physical world, where a consumer can access not only restaurants, but all the local businesses in their community, and receive benefits while shopping\nin-store, at home, or anywhere in between.\n\nIf we are successful in helping local businesses overcome the greatest business model challenge of their\ntime, we believe that physical stores will be transformed and will morph into offering two types of products: convenience and experience. Every category of store on the street will be omni-channel\u0097offering goods online, as well as rich,\npersonalized experiences in-store.\n\nFurther, we believe this will lead to an increase in both local commerce and new business creation. Anyone\nshould be able to launch a business. We hope to become the platform of choice to help businesses participate in the modern economy and enable entrepreneurs to bring their dreams to life.\n\nThe window is closing to empower this transformation, as the rise of ecommerce and other on-demand technologies are rapidly surpassing local businesses.\nTo serve these businesses effectively, scale is paramount, and as the player with the largest market share in our category, we are uniquely positioned to help local businesses compete in the new economy.\n\nHow We Operate\n\nOur greatest competitive advantage is, and\nalways has started with, our people and our culture.

We attribute our category-leading spend retention2and capital efficiency, in part, to this obsession.\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Dream big, start small: We take a long-term view at DoorDash and recognize that the best way to help merchants is\nto iterate quickly on products to help them grow their businesses. While we won\u0092t optimize for quarterly changes to our business, we also won\u0092t pursue 1,000 things at once or begin a project without enough resources. While we plan and\ninvest for the long term, we begin projects in one market, with a lean team, and with very little capital and ask them to earn their way toward increasing investment. These constraints, we believe, help drive creativity, in much the same way\nDoorDash was founded.\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | We are owners: At DoorDash, our operators are relentlessly focused on execution and hold themselves to the\nhighest accountability levels while carrying no blame. Like the problems we solve, working at DoorDash is challenging. We have stretch goals and we increase them when we beat these goals, always raising the bar. To foster this ownership mentality,\nwe believe in using equity as an important part of our employee compensation.\n[/TABLE]\n\nOur values underpin our operational playbook and\nmake us uniquely situated to seize the opportunity before us\u0097to enable local merchants, to level the playing field for underdogs playing from behind, and to empower local economies.\n\nI hope you\u0092ll join us in transforming the future of local commerce.\n\nOnward and upward,\n\nTony",

Within a few hours, the first DoorDash consumer ordered prawn pad thai and spring rolls from a nearby Thai eatery, and shortly afterwards, dinner was delivered directly to his door.\n\nToday, we connect over 390,000 merchants,\nover 18 million consumers,\nand over 1 million Dashers\nin the United States, Canada, and Australia through our local logistics platform.\n\nOur platform enables local\nbrick-and-mortar\nbusinesses to thrive in\ntoday\u0092s convenience economy by addressing consumers\u0092 expectations of ease and immediacy. With over 900 million orders completed through our platform since our founding, merchants have made additional sales, consumers have connected with\nthe best of their neighborhoods, and Dashers have found flexible economic opportunities.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nTechnology has changed consumer behavior and driven a wave of demand for convenience. Recent events have further accelerated these trends, pulling the\nfuture of e-commerce forward for businesses large and small. Consumers value frictionless online shopping experiences and\non-demand\ndelivery. As consumers demand products and services quickly, inexpensively,\nand at the touch of a button, business is now happening where consumers are: at work, at home, and on-the-go. Local businesses have historically provided rich personalized experiences for consumers who shop\n\nin-store,\nbut consumers are no longer going to physical storefronts for every purchase, and local businesses have struggled to adjust. We believe many local businesses lack the capabilities to reach\ntoday\u0092s consumers or deliver to them\noff-premise.\nAs a result, they miss out on this increasingly important source of growth.",

Accordingly, residents in these markets are more acutely\nimpacted by the lack of alternatives and the inconvenience posed by distance and the need to drive to merchants, and therefore consumers in these markets derive greater benefit from\non-demand\ndelivery.\nAdditionally, suburban markets are attractive as consumers in these markets are more likely to be families who order more items per order. Lighter traffic and easier parking also mean that Dashers can serve these markets more efficiently. As a\nresult of our early focus on and experience with suburban markets and smaller metropolitan areas, we are particularly well positioned for continued growth in these markets.\n\nWhile the majority of our business today is in the United States, we have a strong and growing business in Canada and have also recently launched in\nAustralia. We expect further international expansion to build on the massive market opportunity that is already available to us.\n\nTo date, the\nsubstantial majority of our merchants have been restaurants.

The increase in\nmerchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers attracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or than it has grown in the past. In particular, our national brand\npartnerships are a key component of our strategy to provide a wide selection for consumers. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and our national brand partners, or consumers, the value of our\nnetwork would be diminished. In addition, we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to acquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed\ninto unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may invest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for several years or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and\nconsumers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\n\n\n\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or\nface financial distress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection.

While\nwe do and will attempt to set prices based on our prior operating experience and merchant, consumer, and Dasher feedback and engagement levels, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we\ncould be underpricing or overpricing our services.

For example, under our former Dasher pay model, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little or no tip. Although this \u0093boost\u0094 pay was intended to help Dashers by\nmaking every delivery economically worthwhile, it also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being received by Dashers. Government authorities have also brought claims against us\nrelated to our former Dasher pay model and may bring similar claims in the future. For example, on November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed an action in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia alleging violations of the District of\nColumbia\u0092s Consumer Protection Procedures Act with respect to our former Dasher pay model and on November 24, 2020, the parties filed a joint motion for entry of consent order and judgment to resolve the litigation.

We have also launched, and may in the future\nlaunch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that utilize our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers. For example, in September 2019, we changed our Dasher pay model to include (i)\na base pay amount for each order, which depends on the estimated time, distance, and desirability of the order, (ii) promotions for orders that meet certain conditions, including bonuses for Dashers who meet specific goals, and (iii) tips from\nconsumers, which Dashers receive 100% of on top of base pay and promotions. The base pay amount, any promotions, and any tips that the consumer chooses to include at checkout are shown to Dashers when they are offered a delivery.\n\nWe increased the amount we pay to Dashers per order when we changed to our current pay model, but our current Dasher pay model may also cause less\nconsistency in earnings across deliveries in some cases. Further, this pay model may lead to negative publicity related to perceptions of the complexity of the pay model, inconsistency in earnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways\nconsumers can leave tips, and as a result, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers.

AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard\nregarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs.

In addition, we could face further challenges to the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors as other states where we operate are\nconsidering adopting similar legislation or regulations. A reclassification of Dashers or delivery service providers using a local logistics platform as employees could require us to revise our pricing methodologies and pay model to account for such\na change to Dasher classification, and to make other substantive internal adjustments to account for any transition of a Dasher to an employment position, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which\nmay not maximize short-term financial results and may yield results that conflict with the market\u0092s expectations, which could result in our stock price being adversely affected.",

If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u0092 offerings over ours, our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nFurther, we expect that governments will develop regulations that are specifically designed\nto apply to autonomous and drone technologies. These regulations could include requirements that significantly delay or narrowly limit the commercialization of autonomous and drone technologies, limit the amount of autonomous and drone delivery on\nour platform, or impose significant liabilities on manufacturers or operators of these solutions or developers of these technologies.

We estimated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award using a model based on multiple stock price paths developed through\nthe use of a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the achievement of certain price goals may not be satisfied.

If the achievement of these stock price goals are met sooner than the derived service period, we will adjust our stock-based compensation expense to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the\nvested award.

Our ability to include non-partners on our platform could be adversely affected by AB 2149, which we expect to be signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and become\neffective on January 1, 2021. AB 2149 would prohibit, among other things, food delivery logistics platforms from facilitating deliveries from restaurants in California without the restaurants\u0092 prior consent. Similar prohibitions have also been\nenacted in Louisiana, Denver, Colorado, and Tucson, Arizona and are being contemplated in other jurisdictions. Beyond regulatory restrictions, we may also adopt internal policies that limit or prohibit the facilitation of deliveries from merchants\nwithout their prior consent.

We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplace. We charge partner merchants commissions at an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods\nordered in exchange for the use of our local logistics platform and we charge fees to consumers for use of our platform to arrange for delivery services. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is\nrecognized as part of the DoorDash Marketplace. Revenue generated from DashPass subscriptions is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of subscription purchased by\nthe consumer. In addition, we also generate revenue from Drive by collecting\nper-order\nfees from merchants that use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated\nthrough their own channels.\n\nOur platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform arranges for\nconsumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore further judgment is required to determine whether we are a\nprincipal or agent in transactions with partner merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\n\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\n\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or the agent in transactions with partner merchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it\nrelates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery facilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control each specified good or service before it is provided to the\nconsumer in Marketplace transactions.",

The consumer accesses our platform to identify merchants and place orders for merchants\u0092 products. These orders are picked up from partner merchants and delivered to\nconsumers by Dashers.

These referral credits are\npaid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these credits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer acquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition\ncosts are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess of the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of\nrevenue.\n\nExisting consumer incentives\n:\nOn occasion, we offer promotional discounts to existing consumers. We record\nincentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduce revenue on the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.\n\nDasher Incentives and\nReferrals\n\nWe offer various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These are offered in\nvarious forms and include:\n\nPeak pay\n:\nWe make additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery\nopportunities during peak demand time.",

The present value of the estimated cash flows is then added to the present value equivalent of the residual value of the business\nat the end of the projected period to calculate the business enterprise value. The residual value was estimated based on the projected value of comparable public companies in a similar line of business that are publicly traded.\n\nIn allocating the enterprise value of our business among the various classes of stock prior to January 2019, we used the option pricing method, or OPM,\nwhich models each class of stock as a call option with a unique claim on our assets. We used a combination of probability weighted OPM and probability weighted expected return method, or PWERM, to allocate the enterprise value of our business among\nthe various classes of stock since January 2019. PWERM involves a forward-looking analysis of the possible future outcomes of the enterprise. This method is particularly useful when discrete future outcomes can be predicted at a relatively high\nconfidence level with a probability distribution. Discrete future outcomes considered under the PWERM include an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, as well as\nnon-IPO\nmarket-based outcomes.\nDetermining the fair value of the enterprise using the PWERM requires us to develop assumptions and estimates for both the probability of an IPO liquidity event and stay private outcomes, as well as the values we expect those outcomes could yield.\n\nAfter the allocation to the various classes of stock, a discount for lack of marketability, or DLOM, is applied to arrive at a fair value of the",

Additionally, suburban markets are attractive as consumers in these markets are more likely to be families who order more items per order. Lighter traffic and easier parking also mean that\nDashers can serve these markets more efficiently.

This director compensation policy was developed with input from our independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, regarding practices and compensation levels at comparable companies. It is designed to attract, retain, and reward\nnon-employee directors.\n\nUnder the director compensation policy, each non-employee director will receive the cash and equity compensation for board\nservices described below.

Rather, the CEO Performance Award will vest only if we achieve certain stock price goals, which if achieved, would allow our other stockholders to benefit from the increases in our stock price. The board of\ndirectors believed these stock price goals represented challenging hurdles and, if achieved, would result in a return to our stockholders well in excess of market norms for comparable technology companies.\n\nTo further encourage Mr. Xu to focus on the long-term success of our business, Mr. Xu must hold any after-tax shares that are issued to him pursuant to\nthe CEO Performance Award for at least two years following the date that the portion of the CEO Performance Award vests subject to earlier termination upon a change in control or termination for reasons other than a termination by us for\n\u0093cause\u0094 or resignation by Mr. Xu without \u0093good reason,\u0094 as such terms are defined in the CEO Performance Award agreement.",

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

Beyond demand fulfillment, the Company offers a broad array of services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges such as\ncustomer acquisition, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. As part of the Marketplace, the Company also offers Pickup, which allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders\nconveniently with no consumer fees, as well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on the Company\u0092s platform with large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. The Marketplace also includes DashPass, the\nCompany\u0092s subscription product, which provides consumers with unlimited access to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and reduced service fees. In addition to the Marketplace, the Company offers DoorDash Drive, a white-label logistics\nservice that enables merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using the Company\u0092s local logistics platform (\u0093Drive\u0094).\n\nSince its founding, the Company has financed its operations primarily through the issuance of equity and debt securities and from payments received\nthrough its platform.

The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported.\nLiabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with valuations provided by an independent third-party actuary. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains additional insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions. The Company cannot\npredict whether this insurance will be adequate to cover all potential hazards incidental to its business. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However, ultimate\nresults may differ from the Company\u0092s estimates, which could result in losses over the Company\u0092s reserved amounts.\n\nLoss\nContingencies\n\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with its\nbusiness.

The fair value of\nstock options is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is typically four years. The fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company\u0092s common stock on the date\nof grant. The Company grants RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition, which is typically four years, and a liquidity event-related performance vesting condition. See Note 12 for more information about the\nliquidity event-related performance vesting condition. The fair\n\nF-15\n\n\nvalue of RSUs with a liquidity event-related performance vesting condition is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period, using the accelerated attribution method, once\nthe liquidity event-related performance vesting condition becomes probable of being achieved. In the period in which the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition becomes probable of being achieved, the Company will record cumulative\nstock-based compensation expense for those RSUs for which the service-based vesting condition has been satisfied. Stock-based compensation related to the remaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition\nis satisfied will be recorded over the remaining requisite service period.

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury\nzero-coupon\nissues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock-based award. The Company\u0092s common stock is not publicly traded, and therefore, the Company used the historical volatility of the stock\nprice of similar publicly traded peer companies.

The holders of the Company\u0092s redeemable convertible preferred stock would be entitled to dividends in\npreference to common stockholders, at specified rates, if declared. Such dividends are not cumulative. Any remaining earnings would be distributed among the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock pro rata on an\nas-converted\nbasis. These holders of the Company\u0092s redeemable convertible preferred stock are not contractually obligated to participate in the Company\u0092s losses.\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net\nlosses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive.\n\nDeferred Offering Costs",

The incremental borrowing rate represents the rate of interest the Company would have\nto pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.

The sublease required Sublessee to pay 100% of any rent and other related expenses due and payable under the existing lease with the\nlandlord (the \u0093Head Lease\u0094), however the Company was not relieved from its legal obligation to the landlord under the Head Lease.

Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed\nperiodically based on the ASC 740\nmore-likely-than-not\nrealization threshold criterion. This assessment considers matters such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income,\ntax-planning\nstrategies, and results of recent operations. The evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets requires that the Company weigh all positive and negative evidence to\nreach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Due to the lack of\nU.S. earnings history, the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. Overall, the valuation allowance increased by $51 million and $154 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and\n2019, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had accumulated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of\n$780 million and $576 million, respectively. Of the $780 million of federal net operating losses, $615 million is carried forward indefinitely but is limited to 80% of taxable income.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the combined financial statements. The\nprocedures selected depend on the auditors\u0092 judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the combined financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers\ninternal control relevant to the entity\u0092s preparation and fair presentation of the combined financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on\nthe effectiveness of the entity\u0092s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the combined financial statements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have\nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\nOpinion\n\nIn our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Caviar, a\nbusiness of Square, Inc. as of December 31, 2017 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nEmphasis of Matter",

The fair value of stock options and ESPP shares granted to employees is\nestimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. This share-based compensation expense valuation model requires Parent to make assumptions and judgments regarding the variables used in the calculation. These\nvariables include the expected term (weighted-average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), expected volatility of Parent\u0092s stock, expected risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends. Parent uses the\nsimplified calculation of expected term, as Parent does not have sufficient historical data to use any other method to estimate expected term. Expected volatility is based on a weighted average of the historical volatilities of Parent\u0092s common\nstock along with several entities with characteristics similar to those of Parent.

Fair value accounting establishes a three-level hierarchy priority for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The\nordering of priority reflects the degree to which objective prices in external active markets are available to measure fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation\nmethodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable.\n\nThe Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable\ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. The Company determines fair value based on\n\nF-62\n\n\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value\nmeasurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the\nreporting entity at the measurement date.\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 Inputs that are observable for the asset or\nliability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n[/TABLE]",

The acquisition method of accounting requires use of the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement\n(\u0093ASC 820\u0094). ASC 820 defines fair value as \u0093the price that\nwould be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\u0094 Fair value measurements can be highly subjective and it is possible the application of reasonable\njudgment could develop different assumptions resulting in a range of alternative estimates using the same facts and circumstances.\n\nASC 805 requires\nthe determination of the accounting acquirer, the acquisition date, the fair value of assets and liabilities of the acquiree, and the measurement of goodwill.

These indemnification agreements require us, among other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers against liabilities that may arise by\nreason of their status or service. These indemnification agreements also require us to advance all expenses incurred by the directors and executive officers in investigating or defending any such action, suit, or proceeding.
