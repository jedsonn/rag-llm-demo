Scaringe\n\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Prospective Investors and Rivian Owners,\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I\u0092ve been obsessed with cars. I grew up restoring them in my neighbor\u0092s garage. I had hoods under my bed,\nwindshields in my closet, and engine parts on my desk. As I got older, I realized that these things which I was deeply in love with were simultaneously the source of many of society\u0092s biggest environmental challenges\u0097from air quality to\nreduced biodiversity to climate change. As someone who also loves the outdoors, I was conflicted. Ultimately, I decided to focus my life on helping to drive our transportation system toward a future state that was sustainable and carbon neutral.\n\nRivian was started from a clean sheet\u0097there was no money, no team, no technology, no suppliers, no brand, and no production infrastructure.\nThe lack of constraints was intoxicating for the imagination. It was beautiful, it was flexible, and it also brought a sharp learning curve.\n\nAfter\nassembling a small team, we immediately dove right into designing products and building prototypes. As we progressed, it started to become increasingly clear that our strategy of building an efficient sports car wasn\u0092t right\u0097the singular\nreason I had started the company was to have impact and our initial strategy simply wasn\u0092t going to deliver the level of change we felt we had the potential to drive. By early 2012 we decided to fully move away from the original product plan",

By early 2012 we decided to fully move away from the original product plan\nand began the process of navigating the path that eventually resulted in the brand, product, technology, and organizational strategy that we have today.\n\nI now look back on those early years with deep appreciation for the struggle. It provided us with the time to learn, to make mistakes, to mature our\nstrategy, and to prioritize our focus.\n\nAs we redefined our strategy, we focused on how to maximize impact. We began thinking about the truck, SUV,\nand crossover segments as they presented a massive opportunity for us to demonstrate how a clean sheet, technology-focused vehicle could eliminate long accepted compromises. We wanted to establish our brand by delivering a combination of efficiency,\n\non-road\nperformance,\noff-road\ncapability, functional utility, and product refinement that simply didn\u0092t exist in the market. Our first vehicles would need to\nestablish Rivian as the brand for active lifestyles and ensure the brand could transcend segments, form factors, use cases, culture, and geographies.\n\nWhile thinking through our consumer brand, we realized the need to also focus on building core skillsets and organizational muscles around fleet-based\nmobility. With the vast majority of the world\u0092s passenger miles today being provided in personally owned vehicles, we felt it was important that we build the skills necessary to help shift some of the world\u0092s mobility needs to\nnon-personally\nowned fleets. Initially we thought about this in the context of passenger miles, but we eventually realized that the much bigger immediate need was redefining the logistics and last mile commercial\nvehicle space. We were fortunate to eventually establish a relationship with Amazon to develop a range of commercial delivery vans and an\nend-to-end\nfleet management\nplatform that advances the operations and economics for running centrally managed fleets.",

While I love the\noutdoors and spending time with our products, what really inspires me most is our people\u0097how our team members interact and make thousands and thousands of decisions every day, how we show up for hard discussions, and how we react to seemingly\nunsolvable and complex problems.

Our ability to continue working collaboratively to harvest diverse perspectives and drive creative and innovative thinking into everything we do will\nultimately drive our continued growth.\n\nRivian exists to create products and services that help our planet transition to carbon neutral energy and\ntransportation.

We can spend a lot time debating the specifics of climate change, but the indisputable truth is that we, as humans, are\nrapidly changing the composition of our atmosphere.

This is where Rivian\u0092s potential lies - in creating solutions that shift consumer mindsets and inspire other\ncompanies to fundamentally change the way they operate.\n\nAs staggering as this may sound, and as complex as our objective is, we already have\neverything we need to create change. It starts with harnessing the very thing every human being is born with - an adventurous spirit. There is a reason why we are hardwired with curiosity and a capacity to invent better ways of doing things.\nThe part of us that seeks to explore the world is also the secret to making sure it remains a world worth exploring. Forever.\n\nOur Business\n\nWe design, develop, and manufacture category-defining electric vehicles (\u0093EVs\u0094) and accessories. We sell them directly to customers in the\nconsumer and commercial markets. Our vehicles are complemented by a full suite of proprietary, value-added services that address the entire vehicle lifecycle and deepen our customer relationships. Starting with a clean sheet, we built a vertically\nintegrated ecosystem comprised of our vehicle technology platform, cloud architecture, product development and operations, products, and services. Interconnected by our data and analytics backbone, our ecosystem is designed to deliver fast-paced\ninnovation cycles, structural cost advantages, and exceptional customer experiences, all of which combine to create a self-reinforcing growth dynamic while serving our mission to Keep The World Adventurous Forever.",

As of September 30, 2021, we had no borrowings under our senior secured\nasset based revolving credit facility (the \u0093ABL Facility\u0094).

Final changes are expected by the end of 2021.\nDelay in the effective reinstatement date of California and state authority, or a failure to increase the stringency of the fuel economy and GHG standards, could eliminate or reduce the value of certain regulatory credits. As a result, uncertainty\nremains about the future of the federal standards and the value of credits earned under them. In addition, it is possible other states may not adopt California\u0092s existing emission and ZEV requirements, or do so in a way that devalues such\ncredits, and new entrants to the electric vehicle and last-mile-delivery market could drive down relevant compliance credit valuations.

In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to interpret laws or propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer\nlicenses in their states given our direct sales model.

We expect dealer associations to continue to mount challenges to our business model.\n\nFor customers\nresiding in states in which we will not be allowed to sell, lease or deliver vehicles, we must generally conduct the sale out of the state over the internet or telephonically and may have to arrange alternate methods of delivery of vehicles.

Our decision to deeply vertically integrate our ecosystem has required substantial upfront investments in capabilities,\ntechnologies, and services that are often outsourced by other manufacturers. For example, we are making investments in vehicle technology, manufacturing capacity, and charging infrastructure, and these expenses will appear in our cost of revenue. We\nexpect to operate at a negative gross profit per vehicle for the near term as our fixed costs from investments in vehicle technology, manufacturing capacity, and charging infrastructure are spread across a smaller product base until we launch\nadditional vehicles and ramp production. This dynamic will cause our gross profit losses to increase on a dollar basis even as our revenue increases from ramping production volumes over the short to medium term. Additionally, U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\u0093U.S. GAAP\u0094) requires that we evaluate and carry inventory on our balance sheet at the lower of cost or net realizable value (\u0093LCNRV\u0094).

As of September 30, 2021, we produced 12 R1Ts and delivered 11 R1Ts, and as of October 31, 2021, we produced 180 R1Ts and delivered 156 R1Ts. Nearly all\nof these vehicles were delivered to Rivian employees, and we expect to ramp deliveries to third-party customers as we increase our production rate. We plan to launch and commence customer deliveries for the R1S, a three-row seven-passenger SUV, in\nDecember 2021 following the completion of ongoing vehicle validation and all required testing. By the end of 2021, we intend to produce approximately 1,200 R1Ts and 25 R1Ss and deliver approximately 1,000 R1Ts and 15 R1Ss. Engineered for all of\nlife\u0092s adventures, our Electric Adventure Vehicles combine performance, utility, and efficiency. They are equally capable of rock crawling or carving turns on a mountain road and can leave most sports cars in the rearview mirror. The R1T and\nR1S are equipped with a proprietary set of advanced technology systems, including vehicle electronics, battery, electric drive, chassis, Driver+, and digital user experience management. These technologies can continuously improve and expand\nfunctionality through cloud-enabled OTA updates.\n\nOur vehicles occupy an attractive whitespace, addressing large, fast-growing, and high-margin\nmarket segments, and are designed to accelerate the large-scale adoption of sustainable transportation. The R1T and R1S introduce our brand to the world and will serve as our flagship vehicles as we continue to expand our offerings.

Pickup trucks are commonly used as lifestyle vehicles where the open bed enables customers to carry their gear, sports equipment,\ndo-it-yourself\nproject\nmaterials, or their friends\u0092 couch. The R1T is capable of carrying five passengers, towing up to 11,000 pounds, and carrying large loads with a bed that is 54 inches long with the tailgate up (84 inches with tailgate down) and 50 inches wide.\n\nTrucks maintain a large market share in the United States because of the flexibility and utility they offer. We leverage this core value\nproposition along with the trend towards five-passenger trucks and solved the core limitations that have historically existed in the truck market. With the ability to lock away\n\n\n\nall types of cargo out of sight, from golf clubs to skis to strollers, the R1T allows customers in urban environments and those with families to enjoy the benefits of a truck more easily.

Our philanthropic mission is focused on helping to Keep the World Adventurous Forever by preserving our natural systems for future\ngenerations. Forever is being set up to expand our impact beyond the transportation and energy products and services we make and the associated competition they inspire. We aim to go further to address climate change and preserve the critical\nbiodiversity needed for our planet\u0092s longterm survival. We intend to focus on high impact climate initiatives and preserving bio-diverse land, as these natural landscapes and seascapes are powerful carbon sinks, pulling carbon dioxide from the\natmosphere and storing carbon in soil, grasses, shrubs, trees, coral reefs, sea grasses, and ocean floor sediments. We believe that these preservation efforts will help create a forcing function that helps drive the world to shift to more\nsustainable consumption behaviors and preserve the planet and its atmosphere for the many generations that will follow us.\n\nIn addition to land\nconservation and sustainable consumption initiatives, Forever will include research and educational stewardship intended to help communities understand, appreciate, and learn how to preserve our planet\u0092s natural resources for future\ngenerations. Just as we strive to make the outdoors accessible to all, we need to make sure that we get as much of the world as possible engaged in the transition to a sustainable future.\n\nWe expect that Forever will be comprised of two separate entities: a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, Forever by Rivian, Inc.

Our Board of Directors is aware that from January 1, 2019 to August 13, 2021 (the \u0093Relevant Period\u0094), certain KPMG member firms, including KPMG, contracted with Amazon Web Services, Inc.

However, for each awarded client engagement, the KPMG member firm and AWS entered into separate contracts for professional services with the end client. The\nAWS Partnering Relationships, together with Amazon\u0092s investment in, and relationship with, the Company, resulted in an impermissible business relationship for KPMG under the independence rules of the SEC.

As the CODM reviews financial\ninformation presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance, the Company has determined that it operates in one operating segment and one reportable segment.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe\nconsolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u0093U.S. GAAP\u0094).\n\nBasis of Consolidation\n\nThe Company\nconsolidates entities that are controlled as a result of having a controlling financial interest in those entities. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nGlobal Pandemic\n\nBeginning in 2020,\npublic health and governmental authorities have taken extraordinary steps to contain and combat the impact of the coronavirus disease (including associated variants,\n\u0093COVID-19\u0094)\npandemic throughout\nthe world.\nCOVID-19\nhas caused disruptions to and delays in the Company\u0092s operations, including shortages and delays in the supply of certain materials and equipment. In response, the Company has adapted\nvarious internal designs and processes in an effort to remedy or mitigate impacts of such disruptions and delays on our production timeline, which has resulted in higher costs. The full extent of the future impact from the pandemic on the\nCompany\u0092s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on future developments.\n\n2.

These estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that may\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses in the period presented. The Company believes that the accounting estimates and related assumptions employed by the Company are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable\nunder the circumstances. However, due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates, the actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.\n\nF-7\n\n\nRIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks, and money market funds with maturities of three months or less. All short-term, highly\nliquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates are classified as cash equivalents.\n\nRestricted Cash\n\nCash and cash\nequivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are recorded in \u0093Other assets\u0094 in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash primarily consists of cash held in reserve\naccounts related to contractual obligations. Restricted cash totaled $9 million and $32 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nA three-level\nvaluation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements.

Generally, the Company\u0092s stock options vest based on a requisite service period of four years of\ncontinuous service and upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined under the Plan), which is a performance based vesting condition. RSUs generally vest based on a requisite service period of four years of continuous service and the\noccurrence of an Initial Public Offering (as defined under the Plan), which is a performance based vesting condition. The performance based vesting conditions for options and RSUs are not deemed to be probable until such events occur. Therefore, as\nthere has not yet been a Change of Control or Initial Public Offering, no outstanding awards granted under the Plan have vested as of December 31, 2020. The Company\u0092s stock options have 7 or 10 year contractual terms and RSUs",

The expected term represents the average time the Company\u0092s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As the stock option awards are not yet exercisable,\nthe Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. As a result, for stock options, the expected term is estimated based on the weighted average midpoint of expected vest\ndate and expiration date.

While the Company believed it had a creditable claim, the Company expected that the claim would be settled for less than the full amount and recognized a related loss of $5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe remaining $13 million was reclassified to \u0093Other current assets\u0094 on the Company\u0092s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. After the year ended December 31, 2020, but before the consolidated financial\nstatements were issued, the Company became aware of information causing the Company to believe that is unlikely that any amount will be recovered from the supplier. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the remaining\n$13 million within \u0093Other current assets\u0094 was derecognized and a corresponding loss of $13 million was recognized. The Company is still pursuing payment from the supplier but considers the probability of collection to be remote.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company has been involved in discussions with some of its suppliers regarding their performance and\n\nnon-performance\nunder executed contract terms. While the Company is in negotiations with these suppliers to review, evaluate and settle the matters, the Company has developed an initial estimate of the range",

The Company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.25% per annum based on the unused portion of the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility contains certain\naffirmative and negative covenants and conditions to borrowing or taking other actions that restrict certain of the Company\u0092s subsidiaries\u0092 ability to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, enter into certain\ntransactions with affiliates, pay dividends, and prepay junior or unsecured indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions.

Rivian was\nformed for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, and selling category-defining electric vehicles and accessories. The nature of the Company\u0092s operations during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 was primarily research and\ndevelopment activities related to vehicle development and its related technologies, and\npre-production\nactivities related to manufacturing and sales.\n\nThe Company\u0092s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (\u0093CODM\u0094). As the CODM reviews financial\ninformation presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance, the Company has determined that it operates in one operating segment and one reportable segment.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe\naccompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP regarding interim financial reporting, and do not include all disclosures, including certain notes, required by U.S. GAAP on an annual\nreporting basis.

These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements should be read in conjunction with the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements and notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nBasis of Consolidation\n\nThe Company\nconsolidates entities that are controlled as a result of having a controlling financial interest in those entities. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nGlobal Pandemic\n\nBeginning in 2020,\npublic health and governmental authorities have taken extraordinary steps to contain and combat the impact of the coronavirus disease (including associated variants,\n\u0093COVID-19\u0094)\npandemic throughout\nthe world.\nCOVID-19\nhas caused disruptions to and delays in the Company\u0092s operations, including shortages and delays in the supply of certain materials and equipment. In response, the Company has adapted\nvarious internal designs and processes in an effort to remedy or mitigate impacts of such disruptions and delays on our production timeline, which has resulted in higher costs.

These estimates require the use of judgments and assumptions that may\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses in the period presented. The Company believes that the accounting estimates and related assumptions employed by the Company are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable\nunder the circumstances. However, due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates, the actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and\ncash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks, and money market funds with maturities of three months or less. All short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity\nthat they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates are classified as cash equivalents.\n\nRestricted\nCash\n\nCash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are recorded in\n\u0093Other current assets\u0094 and \u0093Other assets\u0094 in the Company\u0092s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAs of June 30,\n2021, the Company had $150 million in escrow for funds deposited in connection with an anticipated investment in a third party. This cash was classified as restricted cash within \u0093Other current assets\u0094 in the Company\u0092s Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. In July 2021, the transaction was terminated and the cash was returned to the Company.",

As of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, restricted cash within \u0093Other assets\u0094 totaled $32 million and\n$49 million, respectively.\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nA three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs reflect market\ndata obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Level 1\u0097Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Level 2\u0097Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable\n[/TABLE]\n\n[TABLE]\n\u0095 | Level 3\u0097Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable\n[/TABLE]\n\nThe Company\u0092s money market funds were classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in\nactive markets. As of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, money market funds totaled $2,782 million and $3,602 million, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2021, there were no transfers between the levels of\nthe fair value hierarchy.\n\nF-33\n\n\nRIVIAN AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\n\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(unaudited)\n\nResearch and Development Costs",

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nMarketing, Advertising, and Promotion\n\nThe Company expenses marketing, advertising, and promotion costs as they are incurred. Marketing, advertising, and promotion costs are costs incurred to\ninform potential customers about the Company\u0092s products and services, as well as disseminating information about the Company, and its products and services. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021, the Company recognized\nmarketing and promotion costs of $2 million and $4 million, respectively. Advertising costs recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 were immaterial.\n\nConcentration of Risk\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk\n\nFinancial\ninstruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of counterparty credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, deposits, and loans. As of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021, all of the Company\u0092s cash and cash\nequivalents were placed at financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. These amounts are typically in excess of insured limits.\n\nSupply Risk\n\nThe Company is subject to supply\nchain risks related to its dependence on suppliers, the majority of which are single source providers of parts or components for the Company\u0092s products. Any inability of the Company\u0092s suppliers to deliver necessary product components,\nincluding semiconductors, at timing, prices, quality, and volumes that are acceptable to the Company could have a material impact on Rivian\u0092s business, growth prospects, and financial and operating results.",

The weighted-average\nassumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2021 is as follows:\n\n[TABLE]\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2020 | 2021\nVolatility | 40.19 | % | 43.75 | %\nDividend yield | \u0097 | % | \u0097 | %\nRisk-free rate | 0.35 | % | 1.40 | %\nExpected term (in years) | 6.9 | 7.2\n[/TABLE]\n\nThe fair value of RSUs with service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on an independent\nappraisal of the fair market value of the Company\u0092s common stock. The independent appraisal uses a market approach with an adjustment for lack of marketability given that the shares underlying the awards are not publicly traded. This assessment\nrequires complex and subjective judgments regarding the Company\u0092s projected financial and operating results, business risks, liquidity of ordinary shares, operating history and prospects.\n\n10.

Similar to the\nCompany\u0092s existing options and RSUs, the performance based vesting conditions are not deemed to be probable until such events occur. The issuance of these options and RSUs has resulted in an incremental $496 million of unrecognized stock-based\ncompensation.\n\nDuring October 2021, the Company modified the service-based vesting terms of approximately 6 million options. As the modified\noptions contain a performance condition that is satisfied upon a Change of Control, the fair value of the options was remeasured on the date of modification which resulted in an increase in unrecognized compensation cost of approximately $265\nmillion.\n\nIn October 2021, the Company approved the funding of Forever by Rivian, Inc. (the Company\u0092s social welfare organization) with\nshares of the Company\u0092s Class A common stock, subject to the completion of its initial public offering. The approved amount is equal to 1% of the Company\u0092s outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis immediately before the\ncompletion of the initial public offering. As a result of this donation, the Company will recognize a one-time, non-cash expense, the amount of which is dependent upon the ultimate price per share recognized at the time of the offering (e.g., the\nexpense would be approximately $603 million if the initial public offering price were $73.00 per share, which is currently the midpoint of the estimated initial public offering price range).\n\nF-45\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\nINFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS\n\nItem 13.\nOther Expenses of Issuance and Distribution.\n\nThe following table sets forth the costs and expenses, other than the underwriting discounts and\ncommissions, payable by Rivian Automotive, Inc.
