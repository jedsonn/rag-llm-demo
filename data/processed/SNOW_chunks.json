We deliver our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use.\nOur platform solves the decades-old problem of data silos and data governance. Leveraging the elasticity and performance of the public cloud, our platform enables customers to unify and query data to support a wide variety of use cases. It also provides frictionless and governed data access so users can securely share data inside and outside of their organizations, generally without copying or moving the underlying data. As a result, customers can blend existing data with new data for broader context, augment data science efforts, or create new monetization streams. Delivered as a service, our platform requires near-zero maintenance, enabling customers to focus on deriving value from their data rather than managing infrastructure.\nOur cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable layers across storage, compute, and cloud services. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured and semi-structured data to create a unified data record. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases without latency. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case's performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 22 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are interconnected to create our single Cloud Data Platform, delivering a consistent, global user experience.\nOur platform supports a wide range of use cases that enable our customers' most important business objectives, including data engineering, data lake, data warehousing, data science, data applications, and data sharing.

Legacy database architectures have inherent scalability and capacity constraints and were not originally designed for the adoption of cloud-based workloads. These shortcomings have resulted in data silos, governance challenges, and limited business insights. Big data architectures have attempted to solve the problem of data silos with large pools of cost-effective storage, but in doing so have often created data integrity and governance challenges. In recent years, cloud-based companies, including certain public cloud providers, have introduced solutions that are derived from legacy database and big data architectures. Despite being deployed in the public cloud, these solutions generally suffer from the same limitations due to weaknesses in the underlying architectures.\nThese existing solutions have some or all of the following limitations:\n\u2022\nNot built for today's dynamic and diverse data requirements.\nLegacy database architectures typically fail to capture, manage, organize, and classify semi-structured data. Big data architectures can capture diverse data types, but the data is generally stored in inconsistent formats requiring transformation prior to use, often resulting in errors and duplicates.\n\u2022\nInability to support large data volumes.",

As a result of our limited operating history, our ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance.\nFurther, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our platform, increased competition, changes to technology, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities. We have also encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described below. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer.\nWe may not have visibility into our financial position and results of operations.",

Unlike a subscription-based business model, in which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription, we generally recognize revenue on consumption. Because our customers have flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we do not have the visibility into the timing of revenue recognition that a typical subscription-based software company has. There is a risk that customers will consume our platform more slowly than we expect, and our actual results may differ from our forecasts. Further, investors and securities analysts may not understand how our consumption-based business model differs from a subscription-based business model, and our business model may be compared to subscription-based business models.

We incur significant up-front time and expense, which subjects us to additional compliance risks and costs, without any assurance that we (or a third-party distributor or reseller) will win a contract. Beyond this, demand for our platform may be adversely impacted by public sector budgetary cycles, and funding availability that in any given fiscal cycle may be reduced or delayed, including in connection with an extended federal government shutdown. Further, if we are or our partners are successful in receiving a bid award, that award could be challenged by one or more competitive bidders. Bid protests may result in an increase in expenses related to obtaining contract awards or an unfavorable modification or loss of an award. In the event a bid protest is unsuccessful, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. As a result of these lengthy and uncertain sales cycles, it is difficult for us to predict the timing of entering into customer agreements with government entities.\nIn addition, public sector customers may have contractual, statutory, or regulatory rights to terminate current contracts with us or our third-party distributors or resellers for convenience or due to a default, though such risk may be assumed by such third-party distributors or resellers.",

If a contract is terminated due to a default, we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative products or services or be precluded from doing further business with government entities. Further, entities providing services to governments are required to comply with a variety of complex laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, or performance of government contracts that give public sector customers substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. These may include rights with respect to price protection, the accuracy of information provided to the government, contractor compliance with supplier diversity policies, and other terms that are particular to government contracts, such as termination rights. These rules may apply to us or third-party resellers or distributors whose practices we may not control. Such parties' non-compliance could result in repercussions with respect to contractual and customer satisfaction issues.\n\nIn addition, federal, state, and local governments routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with these requirements. If, as a result of an audit, it is determined that we have failed to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, costs associated with the triggering of price reduction clauses, fines, and suspensions or debarment from future government business, and we may suffer reputational harm.",

Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several countries have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which could apply to our business.\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.",

Product revenue includes compute, storage, and data transfer resources, which are consumed by customers on our platform as a single, integrated offering. Customers have the flexibility to consume more than their contracted capacity during the contract term and may have the ability to roll over unused capacity to future periods, generally on the purchase of additional capacity at renewal. Our consumption-based business model distinguishes us from subscription-based software companies that generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract term and may not permit rollover. Because customers have flexibility in the timing of their consumption, which can exceed their contracted capacity or extend beyond the original contract term in many cases, the amount of product revenue recognized in a given period is an important indicator of customer satisfaction and the value derived from our platform. While customer use of our platform in any period is not necessarily indicative of future use, we estimate future revenue using predictive models based on customers' historical usage to plan and issue financial forecasts. Product revenue excludes our professional services and other revenue, which has been less than 10% of total revenue in each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended July 31, 2019 and 2020.",

We monitor our dollar-based net revenue retention rate to measure this growth. To calculate this metric, we first specify a measurement period consisting of the trailing two years from our current period end. Next, we define as our measurement cohort the population of customers\nunder capacity contracts\nthat used our platform at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period. We then calculate our net revenue retention rate as the quotient obtained by dividing our product revenue from this cohort in the second year of the measurement period by our product revenue from this cohort in the first year of the measurement period. Any customer in the cohort that did not use our platform in the second year remains in the calculation and contributes zero product revenue in the second year. Our net revenue retention rate is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity.\nSince we will continue to attribute the historical product revenue to the consolidated contract, consolidation of capacity contracts within a customer's organization typically will not impact our net revenue retention rate unless one of those customers was not a customer at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period.\nWe expect our net revenue retention rate to decrease over time as customers that have consumed our platform for an extended period of time become a larger portion of both our overall customer base and our product revenue that we use to calculate net revenue retention rate, and as their consumption growth primarily relates to existing use cases rather than new use cases.\nCustomers with Trailing 12-Month Product Revenue Greater than $1 Million",

To realize this vision, we are pioneering the Data Cloud, an ecosystem where Snowflake customers, partners, and data providers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways.\nOur Cloud Data Platform is the innovative technology that powers the Data Cloud. Our platform enables customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data-driven applications, and share data. We deliver our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use.\nOur platform solves the decades-old problem of data silos and data governance. Leveraging the elasticity and performance of the public cloud, our platform enables customers to unify and query data to support a wide variety of use cases. It also provides frictionless and governed data access so users can securely share data inside and outside of their organizations, generally without copying or moving the underlying data. As a result, customers can blend existing data with new data for broader context, augment data science efforts, or create new monetization streams. Delivered as a service, our platform requires near-zero maintenance, enabling customers to focus on deriving value from their data rather than managing infrastructure.\nSnowflake was started in 2012 to create a data warehouse built for the cloud. Beginning with our first customers in 2014, the response was beyond our expectations as we addressed major shortcomings of existing solutions and expanded from a data warehouse into an integrated cloud data platform. What began as a journey to the cloud has evolved into a much more powerful vision of the Data Cloud.",

What began as a journey to the cloud has evolved into a much more powerful vision of the Data Cloud. From July 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020, we processed an average of 507 million daily queries across all of our customer accounts, up from an average of 254 million daily queries during the corresponding month of the prior fiscal year. The number of daily queries does not directly correlate with revenue, as revenue is further dependent upon the duration of such queries, the type of resource used, and the volume of data processed for the queries, among other factors.\nOur cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable layers across storage, compute, and cloud services. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured and semi-structured data to create a unified data record. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases without latency. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case's performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 22 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are interconnected to create our single Cloud Data Platform, delivering a consistent, global user experience.\nWe generate the substantial majority of our revenue from fees charged to our customers based on the storage, compute, and data transfer resources consumed on our platform as a single, integrated offering. For storage resources, consumption fees are based on the average terabytes per month of all of the customer's data stored in our platform. For compute resources, consumption fees are based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For data transfer resources, consumption fees are based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed.",

For data transfer resources, consumption fees are based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed.\n\nOur customers typically enter into capacity arrangements on an annual basis, or consume our platform under on-demand arrangements in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. Consumption for most customers accelerates from the beginning of their usage to the end of their contract terms and often exceeds their initial capacity commitment amounts. When this occurs, our customers have the option to amend their existing agreement with us to purchase additional capacity or request early renewals. When a customer's consumption during the contract term does not exceed its capacity commitment amount, it may have the option to roll over any unused capacity to future periods, generally on the purchase of additional capacity. For these reasons, we believe our deferred revenue is not a meaningful indicator of future revenue that will be recognized in any given time period.\nOur go-to-market strategy is focused on acquiring new customers and driving continued use of our platform for existing customers.\nWe primarily focus our selling efforts on large organizations and sell our platform through a direct sales force, which targets technical and business leaders who are adopting a cloud strategy and leveraging data to improve their business performance. Our sales organization is comprised of sales development, inside sales, and field sales personnel and is segmented by the size of prospective customers.\nOnce our platform has been adopted, we focus on increasing the migration of additional customer workloads to our platform to drive increased consumption, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate, which exceeded 150% as of January 31, 2019 and 2020 and July 31, 2020.\nOur platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries.",

Next, we define as our measurement cohort the population of customers\nunder capacity contracts\nthat used our platform at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period.

Any customer in the cohort that did not use our platform in the second year remains in the calculation and contributes zero product revenue in the second year.\nOur net revenue retention rate is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. Since we will continue to attribute the historical product revenue to the consolidated contract, consolidation of capacity contracts within a customer's organization typically will not impact our net revenue retention rate unless one of those customers was not a customer at any point in the first month of the first year of the measurement period.\nWe expect our net revenue retention rate to decrease over time as customers that have consumed our platform for an extended period of time become a larger portion of both our overall customer base and our product revenue that we use to calculate net revenue retention rate, and as their consumption growth primarily relates to existing use cases rather than new use cases.\n\nCustomers with Trailing 12-Month Product Revenue Greater than $1 Million\nLarge customer relationships lead to scale and operating leverage in our business model.

The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, a modest adverse impact on certain parts of our business following the implementation of shelter-in-place orders to mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19, including a lengthening of the sales cycle for some prospective customers and delays in the delivery of professional services and trainings to our customers. We have also experienced, and may continue to experience, a modest positive impact on other aspects of our business, including an increase in consumption of our platform by existing customers. Moreover, we have seen slower growth in certain operating expenses due to reduced business travel, deferred hiring for some positions, and the virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events. While a reduction in operating expenses may have an immediate positive impact on our results of operations, we do not yet have visibility into the full impact this will have on our business. We cannot predict how long we will continue to experience these impacts as shelter-in-place orders and other related measures are expected to change over time.",

In addition, we may experience customer losses, including due to bankruptcy or our customers ceasing operations, which may result in an inability to collect accounts receivable from these customers.

For additional details, see the section titled \"Risk Factors.\"\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe deliver our platform over the internet as a service. Customers choose to consume our platform under either capacity arrangements, in which they commit to a certain amount of consumption at specified prices, or under on-demand arrangements, in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. Under capacity arrangements, from which a substantial majority of our revenue is derived, we typically bill our customers annually in advance of their consumption. However, in future periods, we expect to see an increase in capacity contracts providing for quarterly upfront billings and monthly in arrears billings as our customers increasingly want to align consumption and timing of payments. Revenue from on-demand arrangements typically relates to initial consumption as part of customer onboarding and, to a lesser extent, overage consumption beyond a customer's contracted usage amount or following the expiration of a customer's contract. Revenue from on-demand arrangements represented less than 10% of our\n\nrevenue for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2019 and 2020\nand the six months ended July 31, 2019 and 2020.\nWe recognize revenue as customers consume compute, storage, and data transfer resources under either of these arrangements. In limited instances, customers pay an annual deployment fee to gain access to a dedicated instance of a virtual private deployment. We recognize the deployment fee ratably over the contract term. Such deployment revenue represented approximately 1% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2019 and 2020\n.\nOur customer contracts for capacity typically have a one-year term.

In many cases, our customer contracts permit customers to roll over any unused capacity to a subsequent order, generally on the purchase of additional capacity. For those customers who do not have a capacity arrangement, our on-demand arrangements generally have a monthly stated contract term and can be terminated at any time by either the customer or us.\nWe generate the substantial majority of our revenue from fees charged to our customers based on the storage, compute, and data transfer resources consumed on our platform as a single, integrated offering. We do not make any one of these resources available for consumption without the others. Instead, each of compute, storage, and data transfer work together to drive consumption on our platform. For storage resources, consumption for a given customer is based on the average terabytes per month of all of such customer's data stored in our platform. For compute resources, consumption is based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For data transfer resources, consumption is based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed.\nBecause customers have flexibility in their consumption and we generally recognize revenue on consumption and not ratably over the term of the contract, we do not have the visibility into the timing of revenue recognition from any particular customer contract that typical subscription-based software companies may have. As our customer base grows, we expect our ability to forecast customer consumption in the aggregate will improve.

Because our revenue is based on consumption and consumption is at the discretion of our customers, our historical revenue results are not necessarily indicative of future performance.\nQuarterly Changes in Cost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented primarily as a result of increased third-party cloud infrastructure expenses, driven by the initial cost of new deployments and increased consumption of our platform by customers, as well as increased personnel-related expenses resulting from increased headcount.\nQuarterly Changes in Gross Margin\nOur improved gross margin during the last four quarters presented is primarily attributable to higher volume-based discounts for purchases of third-party cloud infrastructure, increased scale across our cloud infrastructure regions, and improved platform pricing discipline.\nQuarterly Changes in Operating Expenses\nOperating expenses have generally increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented primarily due to increased headcount and other related costs to support our growth. However, after the outbreak of\n\nCOVID-19, we have seen slower growth in certain operating expenses due to reduced business travel, deferred hiring for some positions, and the virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events.

As of January 31, 2020 and July 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments totaling $457.6 million and $886.8 million, respectively. Our investments consist of U.S. government and agency securities, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and asset-backed securities.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments will be sufficient to support working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, the timing and the amount of cash received from customers, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the price at which we are able to purchase public cloud capacity, expenses associated with our international expansion, the introduction of platform enhancements, and the continuing market adoption of our platform.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.

For further information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606,\nRevenue From Contracts With Customers\n(ASC 606) for all periods presented.\nWe deliver our platform over the internet as a service. Customers choose to consume our platform under either capacity arrangements, in which they commit to a certain amount of consumption at specified prices, or under on-demand arrangements, in which we charge for use of our platform monthly in arrears. Under capacity arrangements, from which a majority of our revenue is derived, we typically bill our customers annually in advance of their consumption. We recognize revenue as customers consume compute, storage, and data transfer resources under either of these arrangements. In limited instances, customers pay an annual deployment fee to gain access to a dedicated instance of a virtual private deployment. We recognize the deployment fee ratably over the contract term. Revenue from on-demand arrangements typically relates to initial consumption as part of customer onboarding and, to a lesser extent, overage consumption beyond a customer's contracted usage amount or following the expiration of a customer's contract. Revenue from on-demand arrangements represented less than 10% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended July 31, 2019 and 2020.\nCustomers do not have the contractual right to take possession of our platform. Pricing for our platform includes embedded support services, data backup, and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the contract term.\nOur customer contracts for capacity typically have a one-year term. To the extent our customers enter into such contracts and either consume our platform in excess of their capacity commitments or continue",

To the extent our customers enter into such contracts and either consume our platform in excess of their capacity commitments or continue\n\nto use our platform after expiration of the contract term, they are charged for their incremental consumption. In many cases, our customer contracts permit customers to roll over any unused capacity to a subsequent order, generally on the purchase of additional capacity. Customer contracts are generally non-cancelable during the contract term, although customers can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform. For those customers who do not have a capacity arrangement, our on-demand arrangements generally have a monthly stated contract term and can be terminated at any time by either the customer or us.\nFor storage resources, consumption for a given customer is based on the average terabytes per month of all of such customer's data stored in our platform. For compute resources, consumption is based on the type of compute resource used and the duration of use or, for some features, the volume of data processed. For data transfer resources, consumption is based on terabytes of data transferred, the public cloud provider used, and the region to and from which the transfer is executed.\nOur revenue also includes professional services and other revenue, which consists of consulting, on-site technical solution services, and training related to our platform. Our professional services revenue is recognized over time based on input measures, including time and materials costs incurred relative to total costs, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract deliverables, when applicable. Other revenue consists of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes.\nWe determine revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606 through the following five steps:\n1) Identify the contract with a customer.",

We determine we have a contract with a customer when the contract has been approved by both parties, we can identify each party's rights regarding the services to be transferred, we can identify the payment terms for the services, we have determined the customer to have the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the customer's ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer's payment history or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\nPerformance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. We treat consumption of our platform for compute, storage, and data transfer resources as one single performance obligation because they are consumed by customers as a single, integrated offering. We do not make any one of these resources available for consumption without the others. Instead, each of compute, storage, and data transfer work together to drive consumption on our platform.",

Some of our customers have negotiated an option to purchase additional capacity at a stated discount. These options generally do not provide a material right as they are priced at our stand-alone selling price (SSP), as described below, as the stated discounts are not incremental to the range of discounts typically given.\n3) Determine the transaction price.\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other indirect taxes).\n4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract.\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative SSP.

Revenue is recognized when control of the services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. We determined an output method to be the most appropriate measure of progress because it most faithfully represents when the value of the services is simultaneously received and consumed by the customer, and control is transferred.

Stock-based compensation expense for such awards is recognized using an accelerated attribution method from the time it is deemed probable that the vesting condition will be met through the time the service-based vesting condition has been achieved. If an award contains a provision whereby vesting is accelerated upon a change in control, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis, as a change in control is considered to be outside of our control and is not considered probable until it occurs. Forfeitures are accounted for in the period in which they occur.\nOur option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment.

Both events are not deemed probable until consummated, and therefore, all stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs remained unrecognized as of July 31, 2020. If the effectiveness of a registration statement had occurred on July 31, 2020, we would have recognized $29.1 million of stock-based compensation expense for all RSUs that had fully or partially satisfied the service-based vesting condition on that date and would have $199.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis.

The public cloud is becoming the new center of gravity for data. According to IDC, 49% of data will be stored in public cloud environments by 2025, an increase from approximately 30% today. Additionally, according to a 2019 IDC report, 90% of Global 1000 Organizations will have a multi-cloud management strategy by 2024.\n\u2022\nEveryone is becoming a data consumer.\nHistorically, data and analytics technologies were only accessible for a few, highly trained individuals. The increasing importance of data in the digital economy, and the increase in business applications for knowledge workers, is empowering every role and function within an organization to become a mainstream data consumer. For example, in a 2020 study by IDC, 60% of enterprises cited more pervasive adoption of analytics solutions by more employees and faster time to insights as first order benefits of data and analytics.\n\u2022\nTechnology consumption is moving from fixed capacity to utility.\nSubscription-based business models opened up technology markets to companies that could not previously afford large upfront capital investments and forced software vendors to be more customer focused.

We believe that business models are evolving from a fixed to a utility model, where customers pay only for the resources they consume.\nLimitations of Existing Data Technologies\nMany organizations have attempted to capture the value of data using solutions built on on-premises legacy database or big data architectures. Legacy database architectures have inherent scalability and capacity constraints and were not originally designed for the adoption of cloud-based workloads. These shortcomings have resulted in data silos, governance challenges, and limited business insights. Big data architectures have attempted to solve the problem of data silos with large pools of cost-effective storage, but in doing so have often created data integrity and governance challenges. In recent years, cloud-based companies, including certain public cloud providers, have introduced solutions that are derived from legacy database and big data architectures. Despite being deployed in the public cloud, these solutions generally suffer from the same limitations due to weaknesses in the underlying architectures.\nThese existing solutions have some or all of the following limitations:\n\u2022\nNot built for today's dynamic and diverse data requirements.\nLegacy database architectures were designed for structured data types from internal business systems and typically fail to capture, manage, organize, and classify semi-structured data generated from connected devices, applications, and social media. Big data architectures can capture diverse data types, but the data is generally stored in inconsistent formats requiring transformation prior to use, often resulting in errors and duplicates.\n\n\u2022\nInability to support large data volumes.\nIn legacy database architectures, the storage and compute layers are often tightly coupled. This fundamental design limitation leads to storage capacity constraints, redundant data storage, and insufficient compute resources to ingest and transform ever-increasing volumes of data.",

As a result, only a subset of users or use cases can be effectively addressed at any given point in time. Big data architectures have larger capacity, but often lack the ability to guarantee consistency and integrity of data when accessed and manipulated.\n\u2022\nLack of optimized price-performance.\nSolutions built on legacy database and big data architectures are often time-consuming and costly to operate and require manual organization of data prior to use. In optimizing for price over performance, most big data offerings lack sophisticated query processing that database technologies have had for decades. On the other hand, solutions built on legacy database architectures are often forced to make tradeoffs due to resource scarcity, resulting in compromised performance. As a use case expands and consumes more resources, these legacy approaches can lack scalability and require more time, cost, and effort to provision additional resources.\n\u2022\nDifficult to use.\nSolutions built on big data architectures often result in project failures due to the significant amount of effort required to configure the infrastructure.

To support its business objective of delivering personalized unique experiences to customers, it required a data warehouse solution that was not bounded by any arbitrary limits on storage, number of database objects, number of users or concurrent user queries, while ensuring lines of business could easily and securely share data. With such a large data scientist, data analyst, and business analyst community, it is imperative that performance is consistent and predictable no matter the workload.\nOur Solution\nIn 2017, Capital One migrated its analytics workloads to our Cloud Data Platform. Once implemented, our platform spread rapidly to additional lines of business to satisfy latent demand for greater data access within the broader organization and address new business opportunities. For example, our platform now helps Capital One target and deliver personalized recommendations of additional products to customers. It also enables Capital One to transform and integrate data for near real-time marketing campaigns and to ingest and perform analytics on petabytes of log files going back as long as needed by various operations stakeholders.\nKey Benefits\n\u2022\nManage more data by volume and support more simultaneous user queries;\n\u2022\nReduce cycle time of onboarding of new workloads and use cases;\n\u2022\nProvide consistent and predictable query response time (even during high usage);\n\u2022\nAbility to rapidly scale to meet business analytics demands; and\n\u2022\nMeets Capital One's high availability and resiliency needs.\nFactSet\nBackground",

This resulted in data silos and increased cost and complexity making it difficult to answer simple questions with data. A few years ago, the retailer began pursuing a cloud strategy to consolidate data from multiple business segments and better understand customer activity across brands and channels.\nOur Solution\nIn 2018, the retailer implemented our Cloud Data Platform to perform the analytics workloads for one of its major brands, replacing a legacy on-premises solution. As the retailer continued to migrate additional workloads to our platform, it could consolidate its data and create real-time customer views across point-of-sale, loyalty programs, and banking. Our platform empowered its business analysts with accurate, timely, and continuous data flows and reporting, which has enabled them to build out new data products they could not access on their legacy solution.\nKey Benefits\n\u2022\nConsolidate massive amounts of data generated daily to optimize business decisions;\n\u2022\nReduce the average query time to seconds using our platform, compared to hours using prior solutions; and\n\u2022\nFlexibility to easily move between public cloud providers as part of a multi-cloud strategy.\nOur Technology\nInnovation is at the core of our culture.

The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\n\nMANAGEMENT\nThe following table sets forth information for our executive officers and directors as of September 1, 2020:\n\n[TABLE]\nName | Age | Title\nExecutive Officers\nFrank Slootman | 61 | Chief Executive Officer and Chairman\nMichael P.

Each participant is eligible to receive cash bonuses based on the achievement of certain performance goals, as determined in the sole discretion of the compensation committee of our board of directors. Each participant's target award may be a percentage of a participant's annual base salary as of the beginning or end of a performance period or a fixed dollar amount. In addition, to be eligible to earn a bonus under the Cash Incentive Bonus Plan, a participant must be employed by us on the last day of the performance period, unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors.\nOther Benefits\n401(k) Plan\nWe maintain a tax-qualified retirement plan that provides eligible U.S. employees with an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax advantaged basis. Eligible employees are able to defer compensation up to certain limits imposed by the Code. We have the ability to make matching and discretionary contributions to the 401(k) plan but have not done so to date. Employee contributions are allocated to each participant's individual account and are then invested in selected investment alternatives according to the participants' directions. Employees are immediately and fully vested in their own contributions. The 401(k) plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, with the related trust intended to be tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. As a tax-qualified retirement plan, contributions to the 401(k) plan are deductible by us when made, and contributions and earnings on those amounts are generally not taxable to a participating employee until withdrawn or distributed from the 401(k) plan.",

With certain exceptions, these agreements provide for indemnification for related expenses including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of these individuals in any action or proceeding.

Holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on any matter submitted to our stockholders.

As a result, in these limited instances, the holders of a majority of the Class A common stock could defeat any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. For example, if a proposed amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provided for the Class A common stock to rank junior to the Class B common stock with respect to (1) any dividend or distribution, (2) the distribution of proceeds were we to be acquired, or (3) any other right, Delaware law would require the vote of the Class A common stock. In this instance, the holders of a majority of Class A common stock could defeat that amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will be in effect on the closing of this offering will not provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors.",

These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions, and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering, and a short position represents the amount of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A \"covered short position\" is a short position that is not greater than the amount of additional shares for which the underwriters' option described above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to cover the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option described above. \"Naked\" short sales are any short sales that create a short position greater than the amount of additional shares for which the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must cover any such naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Class A common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

Organization and Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nSnowflake Inc. (Snowflake or the Company) provides a cloud-based data platform, which enables customers to consolidate data to drive meaningful business insights, build data-driven applications, and share data. The Company delivers its platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use. The platform enables the Data Cloud, an ecosystem where Snowflake customers, partners, and data providers can break down data silos and benefit from rapidly growing data sets in a secure, governed, and compliant manner. Snowflake was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 23, 2012 and is headquartered in San Mateo, California with various other global office locations.\n2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nFiscal Year\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. For example, references to fiscal 2019 and 2020 refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2020, respectively\n.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snowflake Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nStock Split",

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nStock Split\nIn November 2018, a 2-for-1 forward stock split of the Company's then-outstanding common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock was effected without any change in the par value per share. All information related to the Company's common stock, redeemable convertible preferred stock, and stock awards has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the 2-for-1 forward stock split.\nSegment Information\nThe Company has a single operating and reportable segment. The Company's chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance, and allocating resources. For information regarding the Company's long-lived assets and revenue by geographic area, see Note 14.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates include stand-alone selling prices (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation, internal-use software development costs, expected period of benefit for deferred commissions, the useful lives of long-lived assets, the carrying value of operating lease right-of-use assets, valuation of the Company's common stock, stock-based compensation, and accounting for income taxes.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and also on assumptions that management considers reasonable. The Company assesses these estimates on a regular basis; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nF-11",

The Company assesses these estimates on a regular basis; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nF-11\n\nThe World Health Organization declared in March 2020 that the recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) constituted a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused general business disruption worldwide beginning in January 2020. While the Company has experienced and may continue to experience a modest adverse impact on certain parts of its business, including a lengthening in the sales cycle for some prospective customers and delays in the delivery of professional services and trainings to customers, the Company's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition have not been adversely impacted to date. However, as certain customers or partners experience downturns or uncertainty in their own business operations or revenue resulting from the spread of COVID-19, they may continue to decrease or delay their spending, request pricing discounts, or seek renegotiations of their contracts, any of which may result in decreased revenue and cash receipts for the Company. In addition, the Company may experience customer losses, including due to bankruptcy or customers ceasing operations, which may result in an inability to collect accounts receivable from these customers. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact the Company's business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.\nThe global impact of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and the Company will continue to monitor the situation and the effects on its business and operations closely. The Company does not yet know the full extent of potential impacts on its business or operations or on the global economy as a whole, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time.",

The unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of July 31, 2020 has been computed to give effect to the automatic conversion of the redeemable convertible preferred stock as though the conversion and reclassification had occurred on July 31, 2020.\nDuring the six months ended July 31, 2020, the Company issued restricted stock units (RSUs) to its employees and directors with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions. The service-based vesting condition for these awards is typically satisfied over four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter, although a small portion of the Company's RSUs are not subject to a one-year cliff vesting period and are subject only to quarterly vesting. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied on the earlier of (i) the effective date of a registration statement of the Company filed under the Securities Act for the sale of the Company's common stock or (ii) immediately prior to the closing of a change in control of the Company.

As of January 31, 2019 and 2020 and July 31, 2020 (unaudited), unbilled accounts receivable of $0.9 million, $2.0 million, and $2.5 million, respectively, was included in accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\nInternal-Use Software Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes qualifying internal-use software development costs related to its cloud platform. The costs consist of personnel costs (including related benefits and stock-based compensation) that are incurred during the application development stage. Capitalization of costs begins when two criteria are met: (1) the preliminary project stage is completed, and (2) it is probable that the software will be completed and used for its intended function. Capitalization ceases when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, including the completion of all significant testing. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation operating activities are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized costs are included in property and equipment. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three years, on a straight-line basis, which represents the manner in which the expected benefit will be derived. The amortization of costs related to the platform applications is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nProperty and Equipment, Net",

Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset, ranging from generally three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of estimated useful life or the remaining lease term. Expenses that improve an asset or extend its remaining useful life are capitalized. Costs of maintenance or repairs that do not extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expenses as incurred.\nDeferred Commissions\nSales commissions tied to new customer or customer expansion contracts earned by the Company's sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These incremental costs are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit that is determined to be five years. The Company determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration the length of terms in its customer contracts, life of the technology, and other factors. Amounts expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are recorded as deferred commissions, current, and the remaining portion is recorded as deferred commissions, non-current, on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As a result of modifications to the Company's sales compensation plan during the six months ended July 31, 2020 (unaudited), a portion of the sales commissions paid to the sales force is earned based on the rate of the customers' consumption of the Company's platform, in addition to a portion of the commissions earned upon the origination of the new customer or customer expansion contract.",

The Company evaluates long-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software development costs, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds these estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group.\nGoodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Goodwill impairment is recognized when the quantitative assessment results in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its fair value, in which case an impairment charge is recorded to goodwill to the extent the carrying value exceeds the fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill.

Lease classification is determined at the lease commencement date. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not have any material finance leases during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended July 31, 2020 (unaudited).\nRight-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments consist primarily of the fixed payments under the arrangement, less any lease incentives. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and include certain non-lease components, such as maintenance and other services provided by the lessor to the extent the charges are variable. The Company uses an estimate of its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. In determining the appropriate IBR, the Company considers various factors, including, but not limited to, its credit rating, the lease term, and the currency in which the arrangement is denominated.

Deferred revenue relating to the Company's capacity arrangements that have a contractual expiration date of less than 12 months are classified as current. For capacity arrangements that have a contractual expiration date of greater than 12 months, the Company apportions deferred revenue between current and non-current based upon an assumed ratable consumption of these capacity arrangements over the entire term of the arrangement, even though it does not recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract as customers have flexibility in their consumption and revenue is generally recognized on consumption. In addition, in many cases, the Company's customer contracts also permit customers to roll over any unused capacity to a subsequent order, generally on the purchase of additional capacity.

Acquisitions, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nAcquisitions\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, the Company completed acquisitions of two privately-held companies for an aggregate of $13.3 million in cash and equity. The Company has accounted for these transactions as business combinations. In allocating the aggregate purchase price based on the estimated fair values, the Company recorded a total of $5.6 million of developed technology intangible\nF-25\n\nassets (to be amortized over estimated useful lives of five years), $1.1 million of net assets acquired, $0.5 million of a deferred tax liability, $0.1 million of a customer relationships intangible asset, and $7.0 million of goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nDuring the six months ended July 31, 2020 (unaudited), the Company acquired certain assets from a privately-held company for $7.1 million in cash. The Company has accounted for this transaction as a business combination. In allocating the aggregate purchase price based on the estimated fair values, the Company recorded $5.7 million as a developed technology intangible asset (to be amortized over an estimated useful life of five years), and $1.4 million as goodwill, which is deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The Company believes the goodwill balance associated with these acquisitions represents the synergies expected from expanded market opportunities when integrating the acquired developed technologies with the Company's offerings. Aggregate acquisition-related costs associated with these business combinations were not material for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2020 and the six months ended July 31, 2019 and 2020 (unaudited) and were included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.",

The significant increase in RPO during the six months ended July 31, 2020 (unaudited) was primarily due to a large enterprise customer entering into a multi-year capacity contract. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, the Company's RPO was $83.5 million and $369.5 million as of January 31, 2020 and July 31, 2020 (unaudited), respectively.
